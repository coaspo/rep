talk Lowfat is good --> food industry added sugar for flavor & longevity

sodium nitrate - artery hardening & damage blood vessels

saturated fats - molecules saturated with hydrogen, have no carbon double bonds
omega 3 - fish & seeds - essential fat

synthetic unsaturated fats convert from cis to trans configuration
  cis : groups attached to carbons of double bond are on same side
  trans: on opposite sides;  in partially hydrogenated oils
     raise "bad" HDL cholesterol and lower "good" LDL cholesterol
     saturated fat increases LDL, not shown to decrease HDL

Why highly processed bad
  low nutrients + long shelf life
  done for smooth texture, shelf life  (bugs do not like processed)
  nutrient densisty  = nutritional value/ energy content
  goal: maximize density / cost
  fat/sugar salt,  color stabilizer

Step wise behavior change
  1. many small changes per week
