Rise of boots and AI hulucinations
   author's job title: "AI and inovations"
   After Pandora let loose all ills what was left was hope.

1. Rise of bot and hallucinations
   ChatGPT: most successful consumer tech in history - 1 million users in 5 days
      will get job evolution not job displacement;
         60% of jobs now did not exist in 1940; hottest is prompt engineer
   When boots attack
     + angry voters --> tipping point to get Trump & Brexit
     2016 election: 40 million fake news tweets
     150K fake (Russian) social Brexit infuemedia accounts
   AI head medling
     ELIZA expert system 1965 won Turing test - impersonates human
     Now talk of "stop the bot", "spot scams & boots"...
     2004 - facebookt & polarization (thinking similar) starts
       to appease Trump Facebook had conservative bias
     AI can read/write/create faster than humans
   Fear index (book)
     spiral human fear; similar to Westworld, Frankenstein, Matrix
     AI informs eviated view of reality
   Hallucinations
     AI makes a false claims; nor realiable
     AI based on human brain will hallucinate like the brain
     the longer the response the more chance for hallucination
  underspicification: training data cannot be representative of current data


2. Defining AI
  Expert systems
    rule base; if A then B
    ELIZA worked so well because of the specific Rogerian therapy
    limited viabilty:
      depend on: narrowness of questions, architecture design, experts,
                 IT professional
    Removal of AI professional: enabled off-site & offshore;
      twinned with globalization  
    limited in scope of human mind
    useless for large data
  Machine learning
    started when large internet data was available
    large images fed to image recognition imroves accuracy
    edge (rare, or black swan events) gives inaccuracy
       similar for text recognition, translation, self driving cars
  Structured vs Unstructured data
    date/time/GPS verus text/audio/video
