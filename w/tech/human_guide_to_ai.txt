   author's job title: "AI and inovations"
   After Pandora let loose all ills what was left was hope.

1. Rise of bot and hallucinations
   ChatGPT: most successful consumer tech in history - 1 million users in 5 days
      will get job evolution not job displacement;
         60% of jobs now did not exist in 1940; hottest is prompt engineer
   When boots attack
     + angry voters --> tipping point to get Trump & Brexit
     2016 election: 40 million fake news tweets
     150K fake (Russian) social Brexit infuemedia accounts
   AI head medling
     ELIZA expert system 1965 won Turing test - impersonates human
     Now talk of "stop the bot", "spot scams & boots"...
     2004 - facebookt & polarization (thinking similar) starts
       to appease Trump Facebook had conservative bias
     AI can read/write/create faster than humans
   Fear index (book)
     spiral human fear; similar to Westworld, Frankenstein, Matrix
     AI informs eviated view of reality
   Hallucinations
     AI makes a false claims; nor realiable
     AI based on human brain will hallucinate like the brain
     the longer the response the more chance for hallucination
  underspicification: training data cannot be representative of current data


2. Defining AI
  Expert systems
    rule base; if A then B
    ELIZA worked so well because of the specific Rogerian therapy
    limited viabilty:
      depend on: narrowness of questions, architecture design, experts,
                 IT professional
    Removal of AI professional: enabled off-site & offshore;
      twinned with globalization  
    limited in scope of human mind
    useless for large data
  Machine learning
    started when large internet data was available
    large images fed to image recognition imroves accuracy
    edge (rare, or black swan events) gives inaccuracy
       similar for text recognition, translation, self driving cars
  Structured vs Unstructured data
    date/time/GPS verus text/audio/video
    reviews - expert system to rate them or machine learning to notice associations
  Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
    humam vs cluster analysis
      cluster analysis:
        identify patterns exceeding human cognition
          examples: find new drug, prevent car accident in unknown conditions
    job safety of editors, copyeditors, truckdrivers
  Neural networks & Deep learning
    replace neurons with transistors=artifical brain
    deep layers of neural networks
    more data-->better performance
      language tranlation, autonomous driving, fraud detection
      parallet text of 2 languages --> one model to translate 200 lanuages
  Generative AI
    text/audio/video input --> new content via probabilist inteconnections
    DETAILS: Wolfram's "what is chatGPT doing and why does it work?"
  AGI - general intelligence
    openAI claims that has AGI - release a tiny fraction of it.
    --> more lieasure or permanent underclass permanently useless
    embed justices into AGI, not so if AGI created by another AGI
  Conversational AI
    primitive version: Siri, improved version pi.ai from Infection AI
  Environmental cost of AI
    OpenAI solve Rubik's cube thru robotic arm consumed 2.8GWh or electricity
      $0.21/kWh --> ~3x.2x10^6 = $600K. 
    Nuclear power plant ~1GW
    Wind turbine ~3MW , 2023 world production ~ 1 TW
    2023 data centers used 7.4 GW; 55% annual increase
  Human+AI hybrid systems
   reCAPTCHA 
   (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart)
   reverse Turing test; machine to recognize human
   cost of reCAPTCHA $0.001/use, blue to Google $0.03, $21B free labor to google
   mTurk - human labor marketplace (20% kept by Amazon)
     workers get $1 to $6/h
     used in research
     crowdsourcing of "human intelligence tasks"
     $2/hour average, max $6/hour + need of break..
 Breeding Centaurs
   half human half machine
   chess, prediction markets
   new ways of human interactions
   or upheaval similar to 1800's early 1900's
