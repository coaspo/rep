Welcome to AI - a human guide to AI  David L Shrier 2023
  Shrier: Oxford business school professor; author's job title: "AI and inovations"
  After Pandora let loose all ills what was left was hope.

1. Rise of bot and hallucinations
   ChatGPT: most successful consumer tech in history - 1 million users in 5 days
      will get job evolution not job displacement;
         60% of jobs now did not exist in 1940; hottest is prompt engineer
   When boots attack
     + angry voters --> tipping point to get Trump & Brexit
     2016 election: 40 million fake news tweets
     150K fake (Russian) social Brexit infuemedia accounts
   AI head medling
     ELIZA expert system 1965 won Turing test - impersonates human
     Now talk of "stop the bot", "spot scams & boots"...
     2004 - facebookt & polarization (thinking similar) starts
       to appease Trump Facebook had conservative bias
     AI can read/write/create faster than humans
   Fear index (book)
     spiral human fear; similar to Westworld, Frankenstein, Matrix
     AI informs eviated view of reality
   Hallucinations
     AI makes a false claims; nor realiable
     AI based on human brain will hallucinate like the brain
     the longer the response the more chance for hallucination
  underspicification: training data cannot be representative of current data


2. Defining AI
  Expert systems
    rule base; if A then B
    ELIZA worked so well because of the specific Rogerian therapy
    limited viabilty:
      depend on: narrowness of questions, architecture design, experts,
                 IT professional
    Removal of AI professional: enabled off-site & offshore;
      twinned with globalization
    limited in scope of human mind
    useless for large data
  Machine learning
    started when large internet data was available
    large images fed to image recognition imroves accuracy
    edge (rare, or black swan events) gives inaccuracy
       similar for text recognition, translation, self driving cars
  Structured vs Unstructured data
    date/time/GPS verus text/audio/video
    reviews - expert system to rate them or machine learning to notice associations
  Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
    humam vs cluster analysis
      cluster analysis:
        identify patterns exceeding human cognition
          examples: find new drug, prevent car accident in unknown conditions
    job safety of editors, copyeditors, truckdrivers
  Neural networks & Deep learning
    replace neurons with transistors=artifical brain
    deep layers of neural networks
    more data-->better performance
      language tranlation, autonomous driving, fraud detection
      parallet text of 2 languages --> one model to translate 200 lanuages
  Generative AI
    text/audio/video input --> new content via probabilist inteconnections
    DETAILS: Wolfram's "what is chatGPT doing and why does it work?"
  AGI - general intelligence
    openAI claims that has AGI - release a tiny fraction of it.
    --> more lieasure or permanent underclass permanently useless
    embed justices into AGI, not so if AGI created by another AGI
  Conversational AI
    primitive version: Siri, improved version pi.ai from Infection AI
  Environmental cost of AI
    OpenAI solve Rubik's cube thru robotic arm consumed 2.8GWh or electricity
      $0.21/kWh --> ~3x.2x10^6 = $600K.
    Nuclear power plant ~1GW
    1 Wind turbine ~3MW , 2023 world production ~ 1 TW
    2023 data centers used 7.4 GW; 55% annual increase
  Human+AI hybrid systems
   reCAPTCHA
   (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart)
   reverse Turing test; machine to recognize human
   cost of reCAPTCHA $0.001/use, worth to Google $0.03, $21B free labor to google
   mTurk - human labor marketplace (20% kept by Amazon)
     workers get $1 to $6/h
     used in research
     crowdsourcing of "human intelligence tasks"
     $2/hour average, max $6/hour + need of break..
 Breeding Centaurs
   half human half machine
   chess, prediction markets
   new ways of human interactions
   or upheaval similar to 1800's early 1900's


3. AI Jobs displacement
  travel-agent/realtor/taxi: Expedia/redfin/uber
  Manufacturing meltdown
    lower income 2.2/jobs/robot jobloss; higher income ~1
    globalization
      low-skill jobs and emissions outsourced to developing nations
    AI automation
      low-skill jobs & services outsourced to machines (2/3 jobs in Dev. countries)
      China spends 2x as US in AI
      Germany, UK, Canada publish more AI papers than Chine
      Trusted AI Alliance
        conform to ethical code(s), country specific
  Bridging the productivity gap: working up the pyramid
    the gap
      1948-2019 US GDP +3%. 2005-2019 +1.4%
    AI may fix it?
      most...least: legal, finance, education ...construction,moving,cleaning
  Predicting next target
    Using patent filing:
      parking attends, locomotive engineers, water plant operators,
      chemical engineers
      least risk: teachers, podiatrists
  Lawyers
    A mountain of Debt and child's sand shovel
    law firms:
      discovery: review documents
        automation:
          OCR. semantic analysis, deep learning...
        billable hours will disappear
    2019: average lawyer 142K debt & less job opportunities
    Signapore adapts legal education to AI
    Computation Law project
      focus on extended intelligence (human-AI)
      litigation-->AI/AI resolution
  Media
    TV, film early adopters; backlash from workers
    Print media no so --> out of business
      advertising hit
      journalist --> algorithm
        average user: 13.2 meters/day  3 miles/year
        algorithms leverage
          provocative false info better than old accurate info
          reality cannot compete with imagination
    Machines determine opinions & thoughts
  Jobs
    47% US jobs replace by AI by 2030
    lowest risk: creative social intelligence jobs
  Uberization of workforce
    Retail jobs could similar to taxi industry
      outsourced, rating based --> more profits, for workers:
         no job security, no collective bargaining
  Elevator asset business (accounting, banking)
  Digital computers --> computers
    AI --> I (includes human)


4. Cognitive flexibility
     get new knowledge; effective in dynamic business
     learn faster in context to work
     tutorial system
       130 years old
       Oxford+Cambridge; finish assignment then meet with partners & professor
       independent and critical thought, analytical and problem-solving,
          written and oral communication and argument skills
       not cost effective
   education problem
     reward conformity, punish outsiders
     squash innate cognitive flexibility
     what/how/how-fst...
     fixed event
   Remake your brain
     1. practice
        innovation: new/useful/in-practice
        frameworks (scaffolding):
          mental model for long term knowledge
          & examples & out of class activities (real learning)
     2. reflection
        anti-cramming, anti-block-classes
        education industry's conflict of interest
        new info --> short term memory
          important info --> long info (consolidation; physical changes)
          (hippocampus --> neocortex)
        sleep - replenish neurotransmitters
                lower cortisol
                memory housekeeping
          keep learn journal before & after sleep
    3. sustained & gradual change
       change learning habits
         little at a time
         patient & disciplined
         30 minutes instead of 2 hours..
       new discipline
         intro & repeated focus
         positive feedback - celebrate
    4. peer learning
       medical education: watch/do/teach; one on one, or max one to four
       not sage on stage
       MIT experiment
         best teams had high emotional IQ, not IQ
           diversity
    5. creative exploration
       (serious play; mind of child)
       AI future: faster, accurate, scalable analytic/quantitative solutions
       marshmallow challenge:
         highest structure with spaghetti & marshmallows
         5 year olds best - just in - try things
         MBAs the worst - search for best answer
       creative collaboration, not solo geniuses
       weak tie theory:
         casual acquaintances more beneficial than strong ties
           networks outside own circle
           valuable insights
           diverse information
       exercise:
         draw, write, mindfulness
       AI max q;
         aeronautics: maximum dynamic pressure q = 1/2 ρv^2
              energy density of the air with respect to the vehicle
     6. Future proofing
        what not to study
          computer languages, block-chain, accounting, actuarial, pre-law
          window cleaning, welding...
        Credo quia absurdum est
          "I believe because it is absurd"
          Tertullian's dictum or paradox
          impossible proposition motivates belief in it, especially in theology
          ex.: new life out of death; glory via the cross;
              become ourselves when deny ourselves; joy in suffering
              paradox: God is one, and yet God is three.
                 solution: give it a name: three is holy trinity
          philosophy: asses facts with keener eye
                      enable AI
        creativity spark
          AI art lack empathy
          AI design may lack aesthetics
          jobs in AI-human interface
        human touch
          patients trusting doctors --> better health outcomes
        art of mind
          AI cannot replace therapists
        prepare for unknown
          feed data to brain
          facebook effect: avoid uncomfortable info
          education reversal: semi vocational training,
                              liberal arts instead engineering
        emotional intelligence
