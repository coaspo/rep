The tipping point, how little things can make a big difference  by Malcolm Gladwell        ðŸ—“ 2000

Intro
  Hush Puppies shoes went from couple NY hipsters to every mall in America in 1996.
  Within 5 years, in 1997, NY murder rate dropped 65%
    --> products ideas behave like virus epidemics
     (1. contagious behavior
         Yawing - seeing or reading it
      2. little has big difference - geometric progression
         height of folding and cutting piece of paper 50 times - goes to the sun
      3. sudden change; Tipping point: dramatic moment in epidemic
        - critical mass, threshold, boiling point
         20% blacks - whites fled to suburbs
         1987 for fax machines, 1997 for cell phones
         neighborhoods with 5% professional jobs
         32 F and rain turning to snow
  How can we start and control positive our own epidemics?

1. The three rules of epidemics
   Causes of 1995 Baltimore syphilis epidemic:
     1. CDC: crack cocaine/risky behavior
          (disease context)
     2. Medical school: reduction of medical services for the poor
          (disease itself)
     3. epidemiologist: demolition of old housing, boarding row houses
         --> housing dislocation
          (people-disease carriers)
   Similar, but more extreme, to 80/20 law:
     20% of people do 80% of work, 20% cause 80% of accidents...
   Law of the few: few charmers set social trends
   Stickiness (in mind): "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should" (as-->like)
     make contagious messages memorable
   Power of context:
       woman attacked & no one called for help - everyone assumed others called
   April 18, 1775: boy hears British saying "hell to pay tomorrow";
     same day 10:00 PM Paul Revere rides and warns in Lexington 12:00 AM
     (When Revere died a lot of people attended..)
     Dawes does the same to Waltham but WO same effect
       Reveres are the "connectors", "mavens", "salesmen"
   Six degrees of separation:
     Milgram sent 160 people in Omaha Nebraska name and address of stockbroker
     and told them to send letter to whoever may deliver the packet
     --> person known after 5 to 6 letters
     Most went through 3 people before stockbroker
        --> small number of people are linked to everyone
     Friends: proximity; people that do the things that we do - not that they think alike
       --> we do not seek friends, connectors enable us to have friends
     Estimate number of friends/acquaintances: got trough a random list of last names
  Connectors: have lots of "weak ties"- friendly & casual connections
    traits: curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, energy, live (ed) in many worlds
    by instinct can relate to people; "I never met a man I didn't like."
     honest, plain-spoken, decent, powerful
    Person or idea/product closer to connector more power & opportunity
