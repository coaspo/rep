When we cease to understand the world   by Benjamin Labatut        🗓 2020
Journalist/writer; understand physics as much as one can without mathematics
"science is still asking fundamental questions... philosophy gave up on them
..literature enjoys them, paints with them, takes them up and works them around"
"Anybody who loves science—or who loves anything, knows that when something gets
inside you, you can’t separate it from who you are"

Prussian blue
  blue pigment produced by oxidation of ferrous ferrocyanide salts
  FeIII4[FeII(CN)6]3
    HCN cyanide, aka prussic acid, used by French in WWI
  Goring's fingers tainted red - due to dihydrocodeine (opioid analgesic) addiction
    100 pills/day
    committed suicide when on trial - bit glass vial of cyanide (KCN)
    glass vials given to Nazi elite on Berlin Philharmonic's last concert
    Bruckner's 4th symphony
  Otto Ranke, gave Pervitin (Methamphetamine; stimulant) on 90 college students
    found it would help Germany win the war
    Blitzkrieg, “lightning war”, was based on Pervitin - in pilot's chocolate
    (meth used by homosexuals in party and play)
  Pervitin antidote when faced by defeat: cyanide capsules - sweet almond
    April 1945 3.8K suicides in Berlin
    families, mothers, generals including Rommel the dessert fox
  Aktion T4: "mercy death" - doctors selected handicapped, sick...
    300K adults/children euthanized
  Hilter tested his cyanide vial on his dog.
  Zyklon B (HCN) derived from Prussian blue pigment Fe7(CN)18
    pigment discovered when trying to make synthetic carmine (red from cactus insects)
    bismuth lead replacement
    vitriol - Fe Cu Al sulfates - sulfuric acid
    cinnabar - HgS red pigment
    amalgam - mercury alloy
  Napolean died from arsenic poisoning from green pigment in wallpaper
  Fritz Haber invented nitrogen fertilizer 1907
    pulled bread from air
    captain in WWI, used chlorine gas 1915 - wife shot herself
    won Nobel 1918 converted from Judaism to Christianity
    hundreds of millions would have died from hunger WO fertilizer
    English dug graves in Waterloo and ground bones for fertilizer
    tried same for ancient Egyptian slaves
    30 million Bison in US picked by poor Indians and ground to fertilizer
    Harber-Bosh process: 1.6 to 7 billion less than 100 years
      H2+3H2 --> 2NH3 DH=92kJ/mol    NH3 boils at −33.34 °C
      used for ammonia when Chilean saltpeter (NaNO3)was blocked
      2021 235 million tonnes world production - very little in US
      NH3 injected 10-20 cm into soil,
      solid form: NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) or (NH4)2SO4 for alkaline soils
    tried to mine gold from ocean water
    invented pesticide cyanide Zyklon (cyclone)
    eliminated bedbugs, fleas, rats, roaches in military
    fled Germany, scorned in England
    died 1934 in Switzerland holding nitroglycerin for his heart
      not knowing Nazis would use Zyklon to kill
        his half-sister, brother in-law, and nephews
      in letter for his wife stated guilt for fertilizer;
        it altered natural equilibrium
        plants with the extra nutrients, would suffocate other forms of life
     wars fought over bird/bad shit
     thieves robbed ancient Egyptian bones to get nitrogen

Schwarzschild's singularity
  1915 sent Einstein Exact solution of black holes
  thought singularity was anomaly from his assumption - no charge, no spin......
  felt irrepressible force to darken his thoughts -
    died from Pemphigus in 2 months
      auto-immune disease, possibly triggered by gas attack
  convinced that Germany was civilizing force similar to ancient Greece
  concerned a star blowing up would extinguish life
  damage left eye from watching solar eclipse
  "we have reached highest point of civilization, all is left to decay and fall"
  singularity worst thing: no meaning of physical laws;
    "if matter can create such a monster, can millions of people exploited to same end"
    "how do we know if we crossed threshold"
     convinced that it was taking place
  Einstein published that singularities cannot exist because
    particles cannot travel at speed of light\
    Oppenheimer: they can exist; dead star compression can go on indefinitely

The heart of the heart
  2012 Japanese mathematician Mochizuki claimed to solve a+b=c problems
    a,b,c are co prime integers; they only share 1 as the cofactor;
      (13, 14) (28, 57) (1, 99) are co, relatively, or mutually primes
    proof is complex cannot be understood...
  pulls out of a presentation
    accused of succumbing to Grothendieck's curse
    but published it in 2021 m
  Grothendieck
    father poisoned with Zyklon B
    made new abstractions to explain foundations of mathematics
    expand notion of point
    12  hrs/day 7 days/week doing math
    get to the foundation of mathamatics
    liked ugly women, squalid houses, dilapidated rooms
    after visiting North Vietnam, changed
      mathematics was a siren song keeping them from what they should be doing
      “sleepwalking toward Armageddon,”
      scientists and mathematicians as the most dangerous people on the planet,
        because they carelessly put destructive technological power
        in the hands of politicians
      obsessed with ecology and armaments
      founded commune of professors vagabonds, prostitutes..
    isolated himself to protect mankind from himself
    fasted, made his own shoes...
    wrote
    "shadow of a new horror"
    "know God more than any other human being"

When we cease to understand the world
  Heisenberg: "What Schrodinger writes scarcely makes sense - it is bullshit"
  Preface
    July 1926: Schrodinger  strangest and most powerful ever created
    predicted behavior of atoms
    Heisenberg had done more complex work 6 months earlier
      objected to view that particles were waves - they are neither waves or particles
      thrown out of Schrodinger presentation
  Night in Heligoland
    1925 Heisenberg for allergy cure went to Heligoland (holy land)
    Bohr told him when it comes to describing atoms, language is like poetry
    published first matrix formulation of quantum mechanics
  The Prince's waves
    de Broglie: all atoms are like light: act like particles or waves
    dissertation committee sought Einstein's help
  Pearls in his ears
    Schrodinger gets from a 12-year old girl a gift of pearls from her earnings
    falls in love with her
    comes up with equation by expanding de Broglie
  The kingdom of uncertainty
    Heisenberg is confronted and drugged in bar by a man complaining:
     On receiving his first phone call, his consciousness of time,
      resolve, self-duty, proportion destroyed;  "tell me professor when did this
      madness begin, when did we cease to understand the world?"
      Hallucinate, picked up a light, and was chased by his shadow
      has vision:
        dead baby on his feet,
        surrounded by thousands of people with slanted eyes
    Replaces particle/wave duality with uncertainty.
    Description of quantum system was not a picture or metaphor - it was a bunch of numbers
      Bohr: that was the end of determinism - Newton's clock-work universe
      past/present/future is beyond our grasp

God and dice
  October 24-29, 1927 Solvay conference in Brussels
    Copenhagen interpretation
      reality is not separate from observation
      science is about our relation of nature as actors - not observers
      scientific method and its objects are not apart
        there is no objective world
    Bohr defeated Einstein's objections --> Einstein reply:
      "God does not play dice with the universe"
      --> Bohr: "It is not our place to tell him how to run the world"

Epilogue
  Einstein tried and failed to find hidden variables
  Schrodinger detested it & came up with dead/live cat to illustrate it

The night gardener
  worked at night to minimize the pain when plants are sleep
  Mapuche Indians crushed skeletons of their enemies to fertilize
  their farms at night & prevent tress from recognizing the warrior fertilizer
  Even scientists no longer understand the world
