Love medicine and medicine  by Bernie Siegel   ğŸ—“ 1986
"a vigorous immune system can overcome cancer if it is not interfered with,
and emotional growth toward greater self-acceptance and fulfillment
helps keep the immune system strong"
  no scientific study supporting these claims
  "Donald Trump of critical illness"
  imagine good cells defeating bad cells

Reflections and thoughts
  Siegel retired from pediatric surgery 1989
  Beneficial side effect of cancer: awareness of mortality --> live meaningful life
    --> learn about beauty kindness and love to share
