Outliers - the story of success  by Malcolm Gladwell        🗓 2008

Intro:
   1896 Italians in Roseto Pesssylvania were outliers in longevity/lack of heart disease.
   diet studies not relevant - church, social support/activism - 2,000 population 22 civic organizations
   Goal: find explanation of outliers

1. Matthew Effect
   (Matthew 25:29 Things are given to those that have more, things are taken away from those that have less)
   40% Canadian hockey players born Jan/Feb/Mar  because of eligibility cutoff is January 1.
     One that turns 10 on Jan 1. plays with one that does not turn 10 until Dec. 31
   Most English soccer players born in Sept/Oct/Nov because of a Sep-1 cut-off
   Older kids in same grade typically score higher.

2. 10,000 rule
   Bill Joy - Sun Microsystems founder - 1970's practiced 24/7 coding in new timesharing computer with a defect
    (pentering k for time requested) that allowed hime to bypass time limit & practice for 10,000 hours.

   Lennon/MacCartney played from 1957, 1960 while in High school played in Hamburg - Liverpool agent was in Londo
   by chance talked to Hamburg club owner - may connections in Hamburg - had alcohol & sex and played all night.
   Lennon: in Liverpool/Hamburg played for 1/8 hours.  Hamburg 7 day/week 3 times for 106/92/48 nights.

   Bills Gates: lawyer/banker parents, 7th grade (19687) in private school that had time-sharing computer terminal,
   mothers raised for money for more computer time,
   1968 Gates began living in computer room.  1971 Gates & friends has 1,575 hours on mainframe - 8 hrs/day 7 days/weeks.
   Used free university computer from 3 to 6 am, worked for power company as an independent study project.

   20% of wealthiest people for 2,00 years are in US within 9 years of one another
    1860-1870 American transformation (biggest ever) - railroads - Wall Street (Civil War 1861-1865)
    If born in 1835 more likely to make it without rich background

   1975 Altair 8800; born before 1952 with IBM job too smug, ideal if born 1954-1955 - Gates, Jobs.. given opportunity
   to work really hard and seized it.

   (1 & 2: achievement more about opportunity than talent)

3. Trouble with geniuses, part 1
   Christopher Langan IQ 195, Einstein 150
   Psychology professor Lewis Terman: foun 1,470 students with IQ > 140 (the Termites), thought they were destined...
     some became famous authors... others failures --> intellect & achievement is not correlated !
     achievement dependent on family!
   education, money, longevity ∝ IQ  (proportionality stops at IQ 120)
   IQ like basketball player height have thresholds: success beyond it is not proportional
   Nobel winners are not mostly Harvard graduates - colleges cannot be ranked.
   Admissions should be lottery based for those passing a threshold;
       27K Harvard applicants, ~3K have perfect APT scores, only 1.6K accepted - 93% rejected.
   Minorities with/without affirmative action: 10%/3% student population, have lower grades but same success as whites.
     OK if smart enough - above threshold.
   IQ (convergence) test alternative: divergent thinking or "use of objects" tests - ways of using brick
   Harvard does not test "uses of brick"  --> not all Nobel winners are from Harvard
   Langan: intellect outlier but not an achievement outlier

4. Trouble with geniuses, part 2
   Langan: dirt poor, no father, abusive step-father (--. mistrust of authority), bullied in school,
           thrown out of college because mother did not fill continue-financial forms,
           no skills to negotiate class schedule because he had no car,
           bitter and angry of missing the intellect energy ""in the air";
           Harvard is great resource if he was to be work there - but is glorified corporation, they care about
           being big shots, if you accept a paycheck you have to go along - (he has it backwards!)
           Published Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) 2002
              prove the existence of god/afterlife using math;
              "can't afford to let logical approach to theology be prejudiced by religious dogma"
           Worked menial jobs - bouncer, rancher ... married chess champion
           Supports 9/1t abler1 & white genocide conspiracy theories, (9/11 was Bushes distraction to CTMU)
           against interracial marriages, dog whistle anti-semite, alt-right champion.
           walked when 3 months old, read at age 3.
           at 50's has horse farm, read books, think of problem before going to bed and dreams of the answer
           reads Chomsky; says better to get the "original source"....
           does not think anyone is smarter than him (not boasting)
           knows that he cannot navigate the world
           --> no one including geniuses can make it alone
   Oppenheimer: did lab experiments 3rd grade, studied physics 5th.  Harvard & Cambridge had depression,
                tried to poison tutor who won Nobel because he forced him to do experimental physics
                got probation with psychiatrist visits.  fought depression

                Used charm to get the Manhattan project job (Langan antagonized calculus teacher and teacher thought
                Langan could not do math)
                son of manufacturer & artist, went to Ethical Culture school
   "practical intelligence": skill to talk out of murder charges, have real communication with teacher
       Procedural intelligence - what/when/how to talk someone for maximum effect and get what you want
       orthogonal to IQ intelligence (Oppenheimer had both, not Langan)
       Practical/IQ intelligence is learned-from/given-by family
       Richer people have more practical intelligence.
   Rich to middle-class/poor parenting  (or high/low education):
      heavily involved; concerted cultivation/natural growth accomplishment
      learn teamwork, customize interaction, entitlement/good behavior, less whiny, distrust, submissive
      well-dressed, alert, poised/no tso..

5. Three Lessons of Joe Flom
   1. Advantage of being Jewish (underdog)
       Joe Flom, Jewish lawyer; Mr. Takeover; poor immigrant parents, grew in depression
       Hostile takeovers were disapproved &  handled by second rate Jewish (non-Nordic) lawyers - Joe Flom.
       Then (hostile) takeovers 100% approved, Joe Flom with 10,000 hours practice was ready
   2. Demographic luck
       Born before 1911 - 20-30 years old during great depression 1929-1939
       After 1912 - got out of college end of depression
       1930's demographic trough; lowest birthrate - kids grow up with more attention more college choices and
       more lawyer-job opportunities to service later baby boomers
       ---> sense of possibility comes from inside us, out parents, and time
