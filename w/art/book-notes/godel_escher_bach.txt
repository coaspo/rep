author: how animate things come out of inanimate
        likens I/soul to vortex/strange loop of meaningful patterns
        first title: "Godel's theorem and the human brain"
        formal system (say math) acquires a self
          weird: formal systems built out of meaningless symbols
        language vs formal: fluid vs arid
        math major did physics taught "the mystery of the undecided"

Principia Mathematica: Russell/Whitehead 1910-1913
