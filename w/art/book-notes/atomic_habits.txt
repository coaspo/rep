Atomic Habit  James Clear -master in biomechanics  2018
https://jamesclear.com

author: got hit with bat in high school - went for top to bottom baseball player
  in college go to bed early, tidy room --> have control, confidence
    --> good study habits --> A's
    --> lift wights --> better at baseball
    after 3 years sleep, study, strength habits paid off
    small changes + long periods = big results
      +1% not noticed/noticed in short/long term
    write every week --> 100K email subscribers ... business opportunity
  "to write a great book you must first become the book"
  general idea:Atomic Habit James Clear
    cue, craving, response, reward
    (Skinner's operant conditioning: stimulus, response, reward
       did not consider internal stimuli - mood...)
    ---> fundamentals of human behavior to build business, family, life

Fundamentals - tine changes make big difference
  1. Surprising power of atomic habits
    "aggregation of marginal gains":
      search for tiny improvAtomic Habit James Clearements in everything you do
      British bike coach:
        paint truck white to see dirt, find best pillow for sleeping..
        went from no medals to 60% of Olympic golds
     1% worse every day -  .99^365 = 3%  one year
     1% better  ''        1.01^365 = 37%
     habits = compound interest of self-improvement (counter intuitive)
     slow improvement --> let bad habits slide
     Single decisions: eat one bad meal, ignore family, wait until tomorrow...
                       easy to dismiss
                compounding these --> disaster
     Small change: like small change of airplane direction
     Do worry about trajectory, not results
     Habits are like double-edge-sword - bad/good cut/build

     Positive Compounding
       productivity: do/automate/master tasks - do without thinking
       knowledge: new idea, new book - new way of thinking old ideas
       relationships: people reflect your behavior;
                      more you help, more will be helped
                      nicer --> stronger connection

     Negative Compounding
       stress: parenting, high blood pressure...
               for years --> health problems
       negative thoughts:
         think self as worthless, fake, stupid --> self conditioning
           ''  others as angry, corrupt... --> see them everywhere
       outrage:
         riots, protests = sum of microaggressions micro-grievances

      Cancer 80% of its life undetected
      bamboo builds roots for 5 years, then grows ninety feet in 5-6 weeks (1.5 in/hour)

      Obstacle:
        valley of disappointment: work hard and do not see change
          (plateau of latent potential; latent heat)
        like plate tectonics(?!) - pressure builds then earth quake
        result vs time is parabolic - not linear

      Seed of every habit is tiny decision - repeat makes habit grow
      Break bad habit <==> uproot old oak

    Forget about goals - focus on systems
      (goal/system: result/process)
      goal pass course, system study
      Prevail wisdom: to achieve something need specific goals
      But.... forget goal, focus on system (goal takes care of itself)
         goal is like direction
      Goal problems:
        1. loosing
             same goal --> more losers than winners
        2. momentary
             cleaning a room versus maintaining clean room
             fix the inputs & output fixes itself
        3. disappointment
             create "either-or" conflict
             path through life will not be what you planned - there other paths to success
        4. not long term
             at odds long-term progress
             yo-yo effect:
               work hard for goal then stop to rest
             set goal: win game
             build systems: continue to play

    System of atomic habits
      cannot change habit? problem is systems (not you[?])
      atomic habit: tiny/marginal change

    summary:
      habit = self-improvement compound interest
      habits: work for & against
      small changes have critical threshold
      atomic habit: part of large system
      systems for better results
      attain goals thru systems

2. How goals shape identity & vice-versa
     habits/exercise/meditation/journaling/cooking: ok for 1-2 days, then hassle
     Mistakes:
       1. change wrong thing
       2. change habits the wrong way
     Layers of change:
        1. results - say weight...
        2. process - actions - habits/systems - routine at gym
        3. identity - beliefs/self-image/judgment
     forget result focused habits
     do identity based habits --> who I want to be
       quitting smoking:  don't: I am trying to quit
                          do: I am not a smoker
     people/organization/society: beliefs behind actions, identity behind habits
     Behavior inconsistent with self does not last
       Behavior == reflection of identity
       If habit makes you proud - you fight tooth and nail for it.
       Goal is not to exercise - but to be healthy

     "I am bad with people"
       repeat it for years and keep falling into it..
       biggest obstacle to change:
         identity conflict
       need to unlearn; edit beliefs; expand identity

     Changing identity (repeated beingness)
       Beliefs come from experience  (not genetic)
       make bed --> organized person
       go to every church --> evidence of being religious
          repeat action --> self image changes
            each action is a vote for identity
            each time you write you are a writer....
        Habit: 1. gets result
               2. enables self-trust
        New identity: 1. decide type of person
                         difficult - what type of person cares for health....
                                                         learns new skill..
                         Keep asking: what type of person would do x....
                         identity shapes habits & vice versa
                         ask who not what/how
                      2. prove it with small wins
       Not about having but about becoming

      Summary:
        changes: outcome, process, identity
        focus on becoming not on achieving
        identity from habits
           action - vote for type of person want to become
        best self: continuously edit beliefs
        habits: can change belief in self not for results


3. 4 steps to build habits
   Thorndike: cat in puzzle box pressed button or lever to exit
      took 160, 90, 60, 15, 28 .....6,7 seconds
      behaviors with satisfaction are repeated
   Habit == repeated behavior --> automatic
            (mental shortcut, automatic solution, memory of steps)
     starts with trial & error
     try/fail/learn/try....
     solves bottleneck of conscious mind
       --> creates freedom
   Build habit:
     1. cue
          behavior trigger; info that predicts reward
            info differs in people
          old cues: food/water/sex
               now: money, fame, power, status, praise, love, friendship, satisfaction
          mind continuously scanning for cues
     2. craving
          wanting reward
          desire/motivation to change internal state
          clean teeth motivation - not brushing
          craving = cue + thoughts/feelings/emotions
     3. response
          getting reward
          thought or action
          occurs when benefits are more than costs
          none if too much physical/mental effort, or if no ability
     4. reward
          1. satisfies craving
               getting in shape not for improving health but for status/approval
          2. teaches us which actions are worth remembering
               via pleasure/disappointment
    WO steps 1,2,3, nothing happens,
    WO step 4, behavior not repeated
    Only with all, habit is formed

    The habit loop
      cue --> craving --> response --> reward  (neurological [habit] loop)
      1. Problem phase:
          cue/craving ; something needs to change
          ALL BEHAVIORS driven by desire to solve problems;
            some problems involve pain....
      2. Solution phase:
          response/reward;
      Examples:
        1. cue: walk into dark room
           craving: want to see
           response: flip light switch
           reward: satisfy craving to see
              habit: dark room --> flip light switch
        2. cue: phone buzzes
           craving: see message
           response: grab phone; read message
           reward: satisfy craving to see message
              habit: buzzing phone --> grabbing phone
        2. cue: wake up
           craving: feel alert
           response: drink coffee
           reward: satisfy craving to feel alert
              habit:  wake up --> drink coffee

     4 laws of behavior change
                          create good habit:            remove bad habit:
        1. make cue:        obvious                       invisible
        2. make craving:    attractive                    painful
        3. make response:   easy                          hard
        4. make reward:     satisfying                    bitter

        for sports, politics, art, medicine, management...
        Ask how to make obvious/attractive/easy/satisfying

     summary
       habit == behavior repeated enough to be automatic
       purpose of habits: solve problem with smallest effort
       habit neurological loop: cue/craving/response/reward
       laws of behavior change: obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying

------------------------ 1ST LAW - MAKE IT OBVIOUS -----------------------------
4.  1st Law: Make it obvious
   Paramedic woman attending family gathering said:
     "You need to go to hospital right now" - then person hearth attack
     She noticed blood missing in face/skin - from working experience
     Hairdressers noticed pregnant clients from their hair...
       --> brain predicting machine
     practice - pick cues - save for later use without thinking
     breathing, being hungry... - automatic loops via chemicals/hormones
   Do not need to be aware of cue for habit to begin
     --> habits are useful and dangerous
     bad habits form without us being aware;
     treats in kitchen, phone in pocket
     Need awareness to change behavior
   Carl Jung: "Until you make the subconscious conscious, it will direct your
               life and you will call it fate"

   Habits scorecard
     Japanese train conductors:
       Pointing-and-calling; point & call "signal is green"
         reduce mistakes 85%, accidents 30%
         eyes, hands, mouth, ears
         raises awareness;
         subconscious --> conscious
       "Point-only" in NY reduced mistakes 57%
       Before going out, say I go my keys, wallet...
       Performance failure:
         mostly due to lack of self-awareness
     Habits scorecard sample:
       wake-up =
       turn-off alarm =
   4.  1st Law: Make it obvious
       check-phone -
       take shower +
       brush teeth +
       ......
         =/+/- neutral/positive/negative - depending on goals
         But habits are not good/bad; really effective/non-effective solving problems
           Ask: "does habit help me be what I want?"
     Observe thoughts/actions and make list;
       WO praise or criticism
       if eat chocolate - note it as someone else doing it..
       if stuck, use "point-call";
         I am about to each cookie, it will cause wight increase..;
         Hear consequence makes it more real..
         Saying "tomorrow I will go to post-office" makes it more likely

  Summary:
    With practice, brain picks up cues that predict without thinking
    When habits are automatic, stop paying attention on what we are doing
    Behavior change stats with awareness;
      Raise awareness:
        1. point and call
        2. create habits scorecard


5. Best way to start new habit
   Exercise habit study:
     control    group 1: track exercise
     motivation group 2:   ''     ''    and read about benefits
     engage     group 3:   ''     ''              ''     ''     and create plan
                        for when where they exercised; complete:
                "Next week I will do vigorous exercise ate least 20 min on__ at__"
                (implementation intention)
      - no difference of group 1 & 2- ~ 35% exercised
      - 91 % of group 3 exercised
   Cues can come from smelling/hearing...
     most common are time and location
   Implementation intention:
     "On situation X I will do Y"
     Increase odds to study, exercise, sleep early...
     Motive people to vote: ask: "how will you go to polling station"
     Benefit: easier to say no for distractions
       For vague dreams, easier to rationalize exceptions.
   Most people think they lack motivation,
     but they actually lack clarity;
     --> "I will ___ at [TIME] in [PLACE]"
     try morning, Monday, at 6:00 PM...

   Habit stacking: simple plan to overhaul habits
     French philosopher Diderot could no afford to pay daughter's weeding
       Catherine the great took pity and bought his personal library for $150K
       He brought beautiful robe, saw that it was out of place,
       so he bought rug, decorated rooms..
       --> Diderot effect:
             getting a new thing creates a spiral of consumption
           Human behavior similar.....
             and action becomes a cue that triggers the next action
     Habit stacking:
       (positive version of Diderot effect)
       identify habit and add new behavior on top;
       pair new habit with old habit
       "After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]"
       Examples:
        After breakfast, I will brush teeth,
          ''   brushing teeth  mediate for 30 seconds,
          ''  meditation, I will write my to-do list,
          ''  to-do list, I do first item.
        After dinner, I will put dishes away,
          ''  putting dishes away, I will wipe counter,
          ''  wiping counter, I will ...
        or with category:
          Exercise: When I shop I will park far away.
          Social skill: I will introduce myself to someone I do not know.
          Finance: for over $100, I will wait 24 hours
          Healthy eating: When I serve meal, I will put vegetables first
          Clutter: when I buy something, I will give something away
          Mood: when phone rings, I will take deep breath and smile before answering
          Forgetfulness: when leaving the house, I will ask if I forgot something
       Stack habits when place/time/frequency is right....
         for specific cues and immediately actionable,
         brainstorm current habits;
         extended habit score card (add column):
             HABIT               THINGS THAT HAPPEN
             get out of bed=     sun rises
             ....                get text message
             ....                song you like ends
       Example:
         "When I take lunch break, I will do 10 push ups"
         --> vague; before or after eating?
         "When I close my laptop, I will do 10 push ups" - ambiguity gone
         specific/exact is very important!

   summary
     1st law of behavior change: make cues obvious
     Most common cues: time & location
     Implementation intention (plan): specify time/location of new habit;
        "I will ___ at __[time]__ in__[location]__"
     Habit stacking: pair current/new habits;
        "After __[current habit]__, I will __[new habit]__"

6. Motivation overrated - Environment matters more
    Anne Thorndike MD:
      made water more available in cafeteria
      --> soda consumption dropped 11.4%, water sales +25%;
      people choose where not what;
      environment invisibly changes human behavior;
      in church people whisper;
      every habit is context dependent;
    Psychologist Lewin 1935:
      B = f(P,E)
      behavior = f(person in their environment)
      Tested in business 1952:
        Suggestion Impulse Buying:
          see product for first time and visualize need --> buying;
          presentation --> buying;
            expensive supermarket items are at eye level;
            cheaper items at bottom;
            foot traffic -->  money machine end caps
              35% of coca-cola are from end-caps.
            We act on most obvious option.
    Human perception: vision(most important), sound, smell, touch, taste,
      conscious/nonconscious pattern recognition,
      body receptors for hunger...

   How to design environment for success
     1970s energy crisis, Dutch homes with meters in apartment used 30% less electricity
     Easy not to practice guitar in closet,
                 read hidden book hidden,
                 use hidden toothbrush
     Fly stickers in Amsterdam urinals reduced spillage --> -8% cleaning costs
     Put apples in center of table not in refrigerator.
     Fill bottles each morning to drink more water.
     Use multiple cues for important habit...
     Live in environment that you, not others, created;
       increase/reduce positive/negative cues;
       be designer, not consumer

   Context is the cue
     people drink more in socials;
       watch friends do it, hearing music, seeing beers on tap...
     behavior defined by our relationship to objects in environment
       couch could be place to read or watch TV...
       research:
         insomniacs went to bed only when tired or sleepy
     Easier to create new habit in new context (have no competing cues)
     Think more creative --> move to big room, expansive architecture...
     Shop in new store to break junk food habit
     "one space, one use": work, sDeckorators Voyagetudy, exercise, entertainment, cooking
       for limited space, use zones - chair for reading, desk for writing...
     Avoid mixing contexts/habits;
       smart phone allows mixing...
       use phone for phone, desktoDeckorators Voyagep for email, tablet for reading
     Trigger focus, relaxation, sleep...
     Predictable & stable behavior/environment
     Everything has a purpose and habits can easily form.

   summary
     small context changes --> large behavior changes
     cues trigger habits; cues standing out more noticeable
     make cues of good/bad habits obvious/invisible
     associate habits with context - not single trigger
     easier to build new habits in new environment (no fighting old cues)

7. Self-control secret
    15%-20% US soldiers in Vietnam were heroin addicts
      When they come home only 5% became re-addicted
        contrary to addiction being irreversible
      In Vietnam surrounded by heroin cues - supply, stress, homesick, addict friends
      Back home, trigger cues and behavior changed
      Typical addict goes to clinic, returns to same cues and become re-addicted(90%)
    Example: No loosing weight
      lacking self-control of just being bad is not the reason
    Shaming obese people stress them which causes to overeat
      careless cues cause behavior you want to stop
    Once habit is encoded, want to repeat it whenever cues re-appear
    Bad habits are auto-catalytic:
      watching TV makes you sluggish, so you watch more TV
      "cue-induced wanting":
         external trigger causes craving to repeat bad habit
         noticing it (30 msec) --> wanting it (WO realizing)
         Can break bad habit but will not forget it;
           resisting temptation is ineffective
           In long-run, we are product of our environment
    Cannot have good habits in bad environment
    Cut bad habits at source - reduce cues:
      - cannot get work done, leave home in other room
      - if watching too much TV, move TV
      (make cues invisible)
    Self-control is short term;
      for long term optimize environment
    Secret:
      cues of good/bad habits obvious/invisible

    Summary:
      Inversion of 1 law of behavior change (make cues obvious):
        make cues invisible
      Once habit is formed, it cannot be forgotten
      Easier to avoid temptation than resist;
        people with high self control avoid temptation
      self control is short term

    Create good habit:
      1st law: Make it obvious:
        1. Fill habits scorecard
        2. use implementation intentions:
             "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
        3. us habit stacking:
             "after [HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"
        4. design environment
             cues of good habits obvious
      2nd law: make it attractive
      2rd       ''  '' easy
      4th       ''  '' satisfying

    Break bad habit:
      1st law inverted: Make it invisible:
        1. reduce exposure
             remove cues from environment
        2. design environment
             cues of bad habits invisible
      2nd law inverted: make it unattractive
      2rd                ''  '' difficult
      4th                ''  '' unsatisfying

------------------------ 2nd LAW - MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE -----------------------------
                          (example: food industry)
8. How to make a habit irresistible
     Niko Timbergen:
       Herring gulls have small red dot on beak -baby gulls peck it for food
         painted red dot on cardboard; bigger dot --> more pecking;
         with 3 large dots ---> crazy pecking
       reylag goose rolls eggs, fallen out of nest, back into nest
         --> any round object - even volleyball!
          "any round object roll it in, if bigger try harder"
       Animal brain pre-loaded with behavior rules;
         Exaggerated cues: "super-normal stimuli"
    Human "super-normal stimuli":
      junk food; salt/fat/sugar (energy dense); survival strategy
      Food industry stretches Poleolithic(3M-12K years) instincts
        perfect flavor, crunch, fizz;
          orosensation (oro: mountain):
            false sensation of taste from tongue stimulation
            example: french fries - golden brown crunchy, & smooth inside
          dynamic contrast:
            crunchy & creamy --> pizza, oreo cookies
        natural foods (kale) feel same, brain looses interest
      Bliss point:
        right combo of salt/fat/sugar
      "We have become too good on pushing our own buttons"
      Exaggerated reality:
        mannequins'  breasts/hips
        social media likes give praise than at home/work
        adverting lightning, makeup....
          all exaggerate things that are attractive to us;
          driving us to bad habits: social media, eating, porn, shopping....
      Future trends:
        more enticing stimuli and concentrated rewards
          food, games

    Dopamine-driven feedback loop
      1954 electrodes blocked dopamine release in rats
        did not eat, drink.. died of thirst in few days
      sugar in dopamine-depleted rats created pleasure
        but did not have desire - action stopped
      Habit == dopamine-driven feedback loop
        eating junk food, video games, social media,
        and eating food, having sex, interacting socially
      Dopamine roles:
        pleasure, motivation, learning, memory, punishment/aversion, voluntary movement
        released when:
          experiencing or anticipating pleasure
          gamblers have dopamine spike before placing bet not after winning
          coke addicts when they see powder not after taking it
        anticipation. not fulfillment, drives action
        reward & anticipation activates same brain region
        Thinking of Christmas/vacation in better than opening-gifts/being-on-vacation

      Dopamine spike:
          cue | craving  |  response  |  reward
                                      ┌───┐
      A. ─────────────────────────────┘   └───   before habit is learned

              ┌───┐
      B. ─────┘   └───────────────────────────   next time when cue is recognized

              ┌───┐
      C. ─────┘   └───────────────────┐   ┌───   see cue but there is no reward
                                      └───┘
              ┌───┐                   ┌───┐
      D. ─────┘   └────────────────┐  │   └───   reward comes a little later
                                   └──┘

      Brain more for wanting than for liking
        wanting: brain stem, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental,
                 dorsal stiratum, amygdala,prefrontal cortex
        liking:  small hedonic hotspots in tiny islands in brain
        --> Desire is engine that drives behavior
            ---> importance of 2nd law: making habits attractive

     Temptation bundling; make habits attractive:
       link an action you want to do with one you need to do
       create heightened version of any habit
       exampFind/fix causes of bad habitsles:
         1. connect stationary bite to laptop so that TV is active when biking
            "eliminate obesity one Netflix binge at a time"
         2. ABC Thursday line up: Grey's anatomy, Scandal, & Murder mystery
              encouraged viewers to eat popcorn and drinsk wine (escape)
              Link what ABC wanted (people to view shows) with
              what viewers wanted (to relax)
       Premack's Principle:
         "more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors"


     Habit stacking + temptation bundling:
       1. After I [current habit], I will [habit I need]
       2. After I [habit I need], I will [habit I want]

     examples:
       1. After I have coffee, I will say on thing I am grateful for
       2. After I say on thing I am grateful, I will watch the news

   summary
     - 2nd law: make it attractive
     - more attractive more likely to become habit
     - habit == dopamine-driven feedback loop
     - reward anticipation makes us act
         bigger anticipation --> bigger dopamine spike
     - temptation bundling:
         pair action you want to do with action you need to do


9. Family/fiends and habits
    Laszlo Polgar:
      rejected innate talent, believed in hard work
      with practice any child could become a genius
      proved it:
        raised 3 daughters to become chess prodigies
        house full of chess pictures, books....
        sisters saw childhood as entertaining
        chess obsession was normal
          --> what ever habits are normal in your culture are the most attractive

    Seductive pull of social norms
      Humans: herd animal; fit in, bond, respect/approval; survival
        Darwin: "Those who learned to collaborate & improvise have prevailed"
          Belonging: deepest human desire
      Earliest habits: imitated, handed down by friends/family church/school;
        get married, have kids, how to spend money
        "Customs sweep us along"
      Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.

    1. Imitating the close
        Pick habits from people close to us;
          smoke pot if friends do it,
          copy how our parents argue,
          assume body posture of others,
          57% becoming obese if friend is obese
          4 Find/fix causes of bad habitsout of 10 students in MIT robotics class became astronauts
        Build better habits:
          join culture where: (1) habits are norm and (2) already have something common
        Shared identity reinforces personal identity
    2. Imitating the many
        Solomon Arch experiment:
          subject took simple quiz with actors that choose wrong answer
          75% of subject did the same
          Similar to ratings in Amazon
        Reward of being accepted bigger than winning, being smart, truth
          making habits that challenge the tribe is hard
    3. Imitating the powerful
        Humans want power, prestige, status
        once we fit in we want to stand out
          --> want habits of highly effective people
          examples: mimic communication of your boss
                    chess sisters: parental praise & unique social status

    summary
      - culture determines which behaviors are attractive
      - we adopt habits approved by culture because we want to fit in
      - we imitate habits of 1. close (friends/family)
                             2. many (tribe)
                             3. powerful (with status)
      - join culture where 1. desired behavior is norm and
                           2. you have something in common with culture
      - tribe behavior overpowers individual - rather be wrong than right by ourselves
      - attractive behavior has: approval, respect, praise

10. Find/fix causes of bad habits
     Book to quit smoking, re-frame each cue:
       - you think you are quitting but you are not quitting, it does nothing for you
       - you think it makes you social, but you can be social without it
       - you think it relieves stress, but instead of relieving nerves it destroys them
      makes smoking be the most ridiculous thing in the world
     Emotions allows you to mark things as good/bad/neutral
     Habit forming things latches to underlying motives/human nature:
       love/reproduce     --> tinder, or ...
       connect/bond       --> facebook, or ...
       social approval    --> instagram, or ...
       reduce uncertainty --> google search, or ...
       status/prestige    --> video games, or ...
         (modern-day solution to ancient desires)
     Life is predictive, not reactive;
       making best guess how to act, based on what you see.
     When a habit addresses fundamental motive
       you crave to do it again

     How to reprogram you brain to enjoy hard habits
       Slight mind-set shift; "have to"  --> "get to"  (drawback --> benefit):
         Have to cook dinner --> get to cook dinner
         "I am not confined to wheelchair - I am liberated by it"
         Exercise:
           "I need to run in morning"  --> "Morning is time to build endurance"
       Motivation ritual:
         associate habit with something you enjoy
           always play same song before sex - when you want to get in the mood, just press play,
           deep breath & smile and then pet dog,
             deep breath & smile --> good mood.
           [habit you want --> something you really love]
      To transform bad habit, reprogram predictions (no easy)

      summary
        - inversion of 2nd law - make it unattractive
        - every behavior has surface craving & deep underlying motive
        - habits == solutions to ancient desires
        - cause of habit = prediction before it; (prediction --> feeling)

    How to create a good habit
       1st law: make it obvious
         1. create habit score card & become aware
         2. implementation intention: "I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]"
         3. habit stacking: "After [current habit], I will [mew habit]"
         4. design environment: make cues obvious
       2nd law: make it attractive
         1. temptation bundling: pair want & need actions
         2. join culture where behavior is normal
         3. Motivation ritual: 1st do something you love, then the difficult habit
       3rd law make it easy
       4th make it satisfying

    How to break a bad habit
       1st law: make it invisible
         1. remove cues; redesign environment
        2nd law: make it un-attractive
         1. re-frame mind-set - highlight benefits
       3rd law make it hard
       4th make it bitter

------------------------ 3nd LAW - MAKE IT EASY -----------------------------
11. Walk slowly but never backward
