</td><td>aa</td></tr><tr><td>Prologue
  Set of ideas made words;
  like a house made bricks.
  Easy to judge/validate a house,
  not so for ideas.

  Word salad;
    palatable reality,
    illusion of understanding.

  Experimental understanding of:
    dogs, cats, humans,
    and broken things.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 1 - Refugees
  Cool summer morning
  under a blue sky
  on the mountain side.
  Grandfather with his three grandchildren
  playing cards.
  All had the same name;
    Lack of imagination,
    ignorance - shadows in the cave,
    shackled and shackling minds,
    behind the smokescreen custom
      part of social security
      like money in bank
      subservience is someones benefit
  Name problem and solution was too obvious;
  he gave them nicknames.
  End result:
  his illusion made them political refugees.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 2 - Future
    Mantle above the card table
    with card sized pictures.
    Large black and white picture
    alone on the light green wall:
      Grandfather's brother,
      formally dressed with a bow-tie
      in San Francisco
      holding small dog.

      Americans love dogs more than people;
        poverty glasses filter
        isolation and loneliness.
      did not matter
      future was black and white on the wall.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 3 - Tyranny
  Cat got the sardines
  instead of the mouse?
  Whatever it was it was serious,
    cat tied and whipped.
    Ugly;
    tyranny;
    brute power;
    and family rated?
    ?
  No isolation, no loneliness.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 4 - Cure
  Clear cool sunny summer day
  family with a cat
  under bright green canopy in the woods;
  breathing was magical.
  Cat to cure
  loneliness, isolation, guilt, exile ...
  Nobody knows.
  Sunny days come to an end.
  Cat disappeared in the night;
  a coyote provided a
  quick peaceful death.
  An angel cured him;
  cat treatment no longer needed.

</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 5 - Palliate
  Crime was a serious faux pas (false step)
  worst than taboo.
  Ostracization instead of public trial.
  The self sentence was worse,
  isolation.
  Tragedies are goat collisions.
  Palliate cats eased the pain,
  death still came.
  He should have known
  there are worse ways to
  die.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 6 - Philosophical
  Anonymous:
    "all diseases are
     psychological,
     untreated they kill"
  "Psychological" abstraction is not real
  just another map.
  "Psychological" --> (pick one or more)
    from:
      spiritual poverty,
      lack of god,
      lack of love,
      evil,
      bad emotions,
      irrational thoughts,
      guilt,
      pathological psychology,
      unbalanced neurotransmitters,
      misguided priorities,
      ingratitude,
      bad influence,
      no influence,
      poor judgment.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 7 - Emulation
  America (economic Shangri-La).
  Freedom, cowboys, self destiny, eternal youth;
    Self deity,
    no illusions,
    no mythology.

      Dog in baby carriage on the sidewalk.
      Eyes see:
        small dog that cannot walk far.
      Mind knows:
        Old dogs have arthritis.

      Dog in baby carriage in Thessaloniki.
        Emulation package comes with:
          Isolation, social media, depression, surveillance phones ...
          Symptoms, diseases follow.

  Future on the wall
    now in screen monitors.

    Same illusions different mythology.
      Cope, pretend, and lie to
      self
      see isolation when it is too
      late;
      when the trip is almost
      over.
    Economic servitude (career).
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 8 - Isolation
  Double speak.
    American:
      isolation is privacy.
    Greek:
      isolation is serenity.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 9 - Dog story
  On seeing a person,
  Dog runs, jumps, and barks.
  Petting, the medication for dog anxiety,
  restores public peace.

    Discussion about
    dog being human-like
    usually follows.
      The discussions that do not follow:
        dogs training people,
        persons being dog-like,
        how many persons does a dog replace,
        why only people "bite",
        dog treatment side effects and trade offs.

    Play with the dog,
    remain a carnivore?
      No need to think:
        "I do not eat dogs."

  Dog medicine for
    emotional,
    psychological,
    and physical health.
    (Who needs people?)
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 10 - Cat story

  Like a baby from the hospital,
  kitten
  came home.
    It was out-worldly:
      Talked to it in
      high pitch voice.
      Entertained it with
      cat toys.

  Cat bored with toys;
    getting old,
    life is too easy.
  Celebrated at birthday.

    Cat trains humans:
      Lies still
      under new sheets when one fixes the bed.

      Spreads out in middle of stairs
      waits
      for caresses.

      Drops on floor
      with a thump sound
      waits
      for caresses.

      Looks into your eyes
      talks soft meows
      waits.

      Looks at the door so you will open it
      so you will go out.

      Mews to express the need.
      Caresses till the end of time.

    Happy to oblige;
      baby talk is fun,
      have a purpose,
      cats do not talk back.

    Cat pandiculation
    (yawn with body strech)
    more common than
    human pandiculation.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Part 11 - Carrot
    A policeman and family friend told told me this:
      We were looking for person
      suspected of rabbit abuse.
      Message on police radio:
       Suspect last seen with
       a carrot.
    Dog/cat fill in - the blank - abuse.
    Emotional slavery more common.
</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part 12 - Questions

  Dogs/cats are catalysts for human-human interaction.
    Non-human <--> human interaction
    maps to
    non-survival <--> survival?

    Dog/cat interaction
    helps us to forget
    the scary survival interaction?

  Dogs/cats are medicine.
    Is palliative care worth the side effects?
    What side effects?
    Cure instead of palliative care? -
      humans to disease
      as antibiotics to germs?

  How many human carcasses do people give and take?
    Why dogs/cats take orders of magnitude more
    without giving any?

    Part 9 -

  Law of being less human
    Machines
    more human-like.
    Humans
    more machine-like,
    less human.
    More time with machines,
    more time with dogs/cats,
    less time with people.

Epilogue
  As of 19-9-2024:
    Writing it was like drawing a
    map.

    This is edited version,
    it misses some things from
    a write-only version.

    Impossible not to write some bull----.
    Way worse to unknowingly read bull----.

  As of 15-10-2024:
    Added material gained on insight and/or illusion.
    Removed redundant material and identifiable names.
    Reorganized - short is sweet.
