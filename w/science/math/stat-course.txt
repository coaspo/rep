histogram
  graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges.
  rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable
  width is equal to the class interval.

box whisker plot
  Minimum (Q0 or 0th percentile): min excluding any outliers
  Maximum (Q4 or 100th percentile): max excluding any outliers
  Median (Q2 or 50th percentile): middle value
  First quartile (Q1 or 25th percentile): lower quartile qn(0.25); median of the lower half data
  Third quartile (Q3 or 75th percentile): upper quartile qn(0.75); median of the upper half data
  less info than  histogram but can compare several data-sets

statistical inference - polling
  selection bias - selection of convenience
  mom-response bias- certain people at certain time may not respond
  voluntary response bias - rating - either good or bad
  simple random sampling - without replacement
  stratified random sampling - divide into groups; urban, suburban, rural
    do simple random sampling in each strata & combine
  random sampling creates chance error
  estimate = parameter + bias + chance error
  sampling (chance) error smaller as sample size increases
  bias (systematic error)- repeats on larger scale, do not know how large it is
  association is not causation
  to find if red meat causes cance
    experiment - treatment/control group
    placebo to control group - avoid placebo effect
    double blind - subject & evaluator do not know who get placebo
  randomization:
    treatment group similar to control group - makes effects other than treatment
      same in both groups
    find effect of treatment by calculating size of change effects

Probability 0 -> 1
    A. from frequency events
       long-run makes it difficult to interpret for single event

Normal distribution:
  height, weight, IQ,
Empirical rule
  2/3 (68%) of data are within one SD of the mean, 16% in each tail
  95% within 2 SD
  99.7% (all) within 3 SD

If data is normal and mean &SD is known, then we know histogram.

Standardize data:
  z = (height - mean) / s
  known a z-score or standardized value - no units mean is 0, SD is 1
  how many SD below or above average
  Z = 2 --> 2 SD above average
  Z = 1.5  --> -1/5 SD below average
  standard normal curve:
    y = e^(-x*2/2) / sqrt(2+Ï€)
Normal approximation
  find area under normal curve
  1. normalize data
  2. find area say between -.5 and 2
  2. area left of 2 - area left of -.5 = .977 -.309 = 66.8%
  empirical rule is special case of normal approximation
  95% + 2.5% = 97.5%
What is 30th percentile (are of left tail of curve)
  from table or software z = -0.52
  area is 30% left of z = -0.52
  height = mean + z*s
  or
  z = -0.52 means .52 SD below average --> = mean -.52 *s
85% to win is rounded off to 100%
         people cannot use probability numbers need stories...
    B. subjective - not based on experiments - differs for each person
  1. Complement rule
    p(not A)= 1 - P(A)
  2. Equally likely outcome rule
    n equal outcomes --> P(A) = counts of A / n
  3. Addition rule
     If A  & B are mutually exclusive (cannot occur at same time)
     example A 1 on first roll, B 6 on first roll, C 1 on 2nd roll
       P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
  4. Multiplication rule
     If A & B are independent
       P(A and B)= P(A) P(B)
  Roll die 3 times find P at least one 6?
    P(6) on first roll or P(6) on second... or on third
      it is not  3 * P(6) = 50%; events not mutually exclusive
    = 1 - P(not 6 in 3 rolls)
    = 1- (not 6 in 1st roll  and  not 6 in 2nd  and  not 6 in 3rd)
    = 1 - 5/6 * 5/6 * 5 /6
    = 51.4%
  P('money' in email | spam) = 8%
  P('money' in email | ham) = 1%
  P of B given A:
    P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
  5. General multiplication rule
    P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A)   had p(A) P(B) because B does not depend on A
    Given
      P(money|spam) = 8%,  P(money|ham) = 1%,  P(spam) = 20%,  P('money') = ?
    Use artificial event 'spam/ham'
      P('money') = P(money and spam) {+(or)}  P(money and ham)
          = P(spam) * P(money|spam) + (1-P(spam)) * P(money|ham)
          = .2 * .08 + .8 * .01
          = .016 +.008 = 2.4%
    Spam filter need P(spam|money)
    P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
           = P(B and A) / P(A)
           = P(B) P(A|B) /P(A)
    P(spam|money) = P(spam) P(money|spam) / P(money)
                  = .2 * .08 / .024
                  = 67%
                  this is posterior probability
                  P(spam) = 20% is prior probability
  6. Bayes' rule
     P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / P(A)
              if P(A) not known, expanded form:
            = P(A|B) P(B) / (P(A|B) P(B)  + P(A|not B) P(not B))

  Warner's randomized response
    toss coin twice
    if tails on first toss answer Q1 have your ever cheated
                            else  Q2 did you get tails on 2nd toss
    P(yes) = P(yes and Q1) + P(yes and Q2)
           = P(yes|Q1) P(Q1) + P(yes|Q2) P(Q2)
    P(yes|Q1) = {P(yes) - P(yes|Q2) P(Q2)} / P(Q1)
              = (P(yes) - 1/2 * 1/2) / 1/2
                from data p(yes) = 27 /(27+30) = 47%
              = 44 %

Quiz:

   = prob of not getting 5 tails in 5 tosses
   1 - P(TTTTT) = 1 - (1/2)^5
2. prob of rolling double
   6 possible doubles out of 36 possible rolls = 1/6
3. to get out of monopoly jail have 3 chance to roll double or pay fine
   what is chance of not paying a fine
   P(roll at least one double in 3 rolls) = P(not rolling 3 non-doubles)

4. 3% applicants admitted, 70% applicants have GPA > 3.6
   admitted have GPA >3.6.. What is prob for admission if GP > 3.6?
   P(admin|>3.6) = P(admin & >3.6) / P(>3.6)
                 = P(>3.6 | admin) * P(Admin) /P(>3.6)

5. 10 questions, each 3 choices with one correct.
   student knows that 4 answers were correct and 6 were guesses
   First question was correct - what is prob that it was a guess?
   P(G|C) = P(C|G) P(G) / P(C)
          = 1/3 * .6 / (P(C|G) P(G) + P(C|not G) P(not G)
          = 1/3 * .6 / (1/3 * .6   + 1 .4)
6. Box 1 has 2 quarters, box 2 2 nickels, box 3 1 quarter & 1 nickel
   (qq qn and nn boxes)
   pick a box and a coin
   if coin is quarter what is chance that other coin is quarter?
   P(qq|q) = P(qq & p) / P(q)
           = P(q|qq) * P(qq) / P(q)
           = P(q|qq) * P(qq) / (P(q|qq) * P(qq) + P(q|qn) * P(qn) + P(q|nn) * P(nn))
           = 1 * 1/3 / (1 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 1/3 + 0 * 1/3)

What is probability that 2 out of 3 newborns are girls, given 49% girl average
Solution (binomial setting):
  P(2 out of 3) = P(GGB or GBG or BGG)   total enumeration; all possibilities
                = P(GGB) + (GBG) + (BGG) addition rule; mutually exclusive
                = P(G)P(G)P(B) +...      multiplication rule; independent
                = 3  * 0.49 * 0.49 * 0.51
                = 0.37
   Binomial setting - n=3 - 3 independent repetitions of experiment (giving birth)
     each experiment has 2 outcome: success(of interest) / failure
     for large n:
       binomial coefficient - arrange k successes in n experiments
         (n k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!)
         3!/(2! 1!) = 3  above
         select k things from n
           n! - n people n chairs
           n!/(n-k)! - n people k chairs
           n! / (k! (n-k)!) - order does not matter
     4 girls in 6 newborns = 6!/4! /(6-4)! = 6*5*4*3/4*3*2 = 540
