Part I: THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION

1. An animal of no significance
   Specie  Sapiens
   Genus   Homo: habilis, erectus, rudolfensis, heidelbergensis, floresiensis, neanderthalensis, naledi, and luzonensis.
   Family  Hominid: Great Apes or hominids; orangutans, chimps, gorillas, homos
   Order   Primates: hominids, lemurs, monkeys, tamarins, gibbons
   Class   Mammalia: 26 orders
   Phylum  Chordata (backbones): fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds
   Kingdom Animalia: 31 phylum
   Domain  Eukarya: Animalea, Plantea, Fungi, Chromista(photosynth without storage), Protista (algae,  molds)
   Life    Archea (alophiles, methanogens, and thermophiles), Bacteria, Eukarya

   Homo erectus, east Asia for 2 million years - most durable species ever
   Homo florwsiensis: Flores Indonesia 3.5' max height - hobits
   Brain 2-3% body weight, uses 25% energy (apes use 8%)
     why evolution
     to lager brain? unknown...
   Upright position/Bigger brains ---> narrow hips/difficult labor
     --> premature birth --> social support --> education to anything we want
   First tools:  to break scavenged bones
   Very quick rise to top of the food chain (WO ecosystem adjustment)
     with fears and anxieties --> wars, ecological calamities ...
   Fire --> Cooking --> less time to eat, shorter intestines, bigger brains, smaller jaw/teeth
      --> power and control of environment
   1-4% European DNA is Neanderthal, 6% Australian aborigines in Denisovan
   Last Homo Neanderthal/Flores 30/12K years ago
     Sapiens is left because of his language

2. Tree of knowledge
  30K-70K years Sapiens invented bows/arrows, oil lamps, boats, needles (warm clothing)
    art - the lion man in Germany 32K years ago
      --> Cognitive Revolution; Tree of knowledge mutation? accidental...
  Green monkeys:distinct sound for "careful eagle", "careful lion"
    they look up or across...
  Sapiens: language for socializing/gossiping
    50 people --> 50!/48!/2! = 50*49/2 = 1225 one-one relationships
    gossip is essential for cooperation
    Majority of emails, phone calls, blogs, newspaper is gossip
    Historians talk about WWI when they have lunch?
      Most often about wrong-doings... gossip
      Rumor-mongers are original 4th estate;
        1 legislative, 2 executive, 3 judicial, 4 journalism
           journalism: cheat/freeloader protection
    Ability to speak about things that do not exist --> myth, religion...
      Image things collectively:
        biblical creation, Dream-time, Nationalism
         --> ability to cooperate in large numbers
        wolfs/apes do so in much smaller numbers
    Chimps:
      groups of few dozen, hierarchical, alpha male
      acknowledge alpha-male as humans acknowledge king; bow...
      contest of alpha-male is done with coalitions of other males/females
      ties kept via: hugs, kisses, grooming, favors...
        politicians: shake hands, kiss babies..
        alpha chimp maybe contested with coalitions with other males/females
          alpha wins not because of physical strength bur for coalitions
      max troop size is 40 to 50 - very rare up to 100
        genocide: one group kills most members of another
    Sapiens:
      gossip helped built larger and more stable groups
      maximum is about 150 - communities, military units, businesses...
         not need for formal ranks/titles/laws
      Exceed the 150 lint:
        appearance of fiction; believe in common myths;
        city, church, state...
        Judicial system with legal myths
        "There is no God, nations,money, human rights, laws, justice
        outside the common imagination of humans"
        Lawyers are like sorcerers with stranger tales
        A company - say Peugeot is figment of collective imagination; "legal fiction"
        In US "limited liability Co" = corporation (although companies lack body)
          treated as legal persons
      Convincing stories about god, nations, company to millions of people
         ('fictions', 'social constructs', 'imagined realities')--> immense power
         these are not lies
         lies are about facts;
           green monkey lie about lions to have food to themselves
      Cognitive revolution --> dual reality;
        physical reality (rivers, animals..) depends on grace of imagined reality
      1879 French switched from divine kings to people sovereignty overnight
        cultural revolution more adaptive than genetic evolution
        regular chimps to behave like bonobos requires genetic evolution
      Culture:
        Homo Erectus tools did not change for 2 million years; genetic not cultural
        30K yrs, Sapiens traded shells for hundred of miles, Neanderthal did not
        Pacific islanders used Obsidian glass form other island 25O miles away
        common fictions --> trust --> trade
        Sapiens hunted collectively - evidence of herd slaughters
        mythical glue to go beyond the 150 person society limit

3. A day in the life of Adam and Eve
  Evolutionary psychology: present societies, psychologies shaped pre-industrially
  'Gorging gene': instinct to eat high calorie (sweet) food.
  Collective fatherhood: people did not know if people sire by one or many fathers
    infidelity, divorces, psychological problems:
      monogamy incompatible with biological software
    Stone age is actually wood age - mostly wooden tools
  Cognitive revolution --> cultural choices
  Dogs domesticated 15K ago - before agricultural evolution (12K)
    12K old tomb - woman with puppy
  Human collective knowledge is immense
    Human individual less skillful/dexterous/knowledgeable than when foraging
    brain size decreased after agricultural revolution
  Foragers
    life more comfortable/rewarding than shepherds, labors, clerks...
    varied healthy diet (than that of farmers)
    skeleton evidence:
      taller, healthier than the peasant decedents
      less prone to starvation
      30-40 year life expectancy because of infant mortality
    good diet/health/work --> 'original affluent societies'
    but also hard;
      accident --> death sentence
      unwanted babies alder slain
      human sacrifices...
  Farmers more prone to:
    hunger via drought, floods, fire
    disease (?) (tuberculosis, measles came from domesticated animals)
    dense population to foster disease
  Ache, modern foragers in Paraguay until 1960
    valued dead elder buried with a killed little girl
    abandoned middle aged man faced vultures, recovered then
      his name became "vulture droppings"
    older women were burden, younger men snack behind killing them with ax
      "I used to kill my aunts.. now with whites I am weak..."
    babies with white hair killed
    baby killed because it was crying
    violence between adults very rare
    men/women free to change partners
    no hierarchy, smiled a lot, shunned dominant people
    generous, not obsessed with health
    killing babies/sick/elder was euthanasia
  Animism (soul or spirit)
    rock, stream, tree - can be angry, have desires needs
    spirit of dead, demons, fairies, angels
      local beings - not universal gods - particular tree...
    can communicate with all things via speech, dance, song, ceremony
    ask forgiveness from slain deer
    placate spirit that caused sickness
    world does revolve around humans or one group of beings
    generic religion
      thousand of different religions, cults & beliefs
  Theism
    pre-modern agriculturists
    universal order: hierarchical; humans a samll group of gods
    Aztecs, Jews, Christians, Muslims
  30K old burial in Sungir Russia
    boy/girl with 5,000/5,250 ivory beads, 250/0 fox teeth
       and various ivory objects
       45 min/bead --> 3 years of labor
    --> cultural beliefs: 1. leader parents, 2. identified as incarnations
       3. the way they died/sacrificed
  Peace or war
    Evidence from burial sites: 2%, 3.5%, 40% violent deaths
    Now war and crime 1.5%
    20th century 5%

4. The Flood
  45K years ago, Australia, first colonization -crossing 60+ mile channels
    Unique animals:
      450 lb 6 ft kangaroo
      Thylacoleo-marsupial lion,
      Dromornis stirtoni - flightless 1,100lb bird
      Diprotodon 3,500lb elephant-like marsupial
    Last million years:
      ice-age every 100K
      last one 70K & 30K peak
      Diprotodon disappeared 45K years ago
        90% of land mega-fauna disappeared but not any oceanic
        cause:
          lack of fear of humans
          burning forest
        Eucalyptus, tolerating fire, more widespread
        climate change contributed...
    New Zealand:
      No 45K year extinction
      Maori settle 800 years ago --> 60% mega-fauna extinct
    Wrangle island, Russia:
      Mammoths disappeared 4K ago in short time
      (10K yrs ago no mammoths anywhere else)
    Mauritius, of Madagascar
      Hindu majority - imported Indian laborers
      dodo became extinct after colonization
    American continent
      16K yrs Siberian migration
      10K Tierra del Fuego
      giant sloths extinct
      with 2K years 34/47 large mammals extinct
      evidence: poop analysis
        latest sloth poop in Cuba 7K years, when humans appeared
    Madagascar
      large animals vanished 1,500 years ago
      when humans arrived
    Similar for other Pacific islands: sapiens arrives --> extinctions
    Start of cognitive era 200 genera of large mammals
      to start of agricultural - 100 remained
    Sapiens: deadliest specie
    1/2/3 wave extinctions: foragers/farmers/industrialists
      large marine animals survived 1&2but not 3

Part II: THE AGRICULTURE REVOLUTION

5. History's biggest fraud
  Agriculture began in Turkey/Iran/Levant 9.5-8.5K BC
    wheat 9K BC, peas/lentils 8K, olives 5K, horses 4K, grapes 3.5K
  now 90% calories from:
    wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, millet, barley
