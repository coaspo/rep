Part I: THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION

1. An animal of no significance
   Specie  Sapiens
   Genus   Homo: sapiens, habilis, erectus, rudolfensis, heidelbergensis, floresiensis, neanderthalensis, naledi, and luzonensis.
   Family  Hominid: Great Apes or hominids; orangutans, chimps, gorillas, homos
   Order   Primates: hominids, lemurs, monkeys, tamarins, gibbons
   Class   Mammalia: 26 orders
   Phylum  Chordata (backbones): fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds
   Kingdom Animalia: 31 phylum
   Domain  Eukarya: Animalea, Plantea,
                  Fungi; unicellular (Yeast) or multicellular (Penicillium, ...)
                  Chromista(photosynthesis without storage), Protista (algae,  molds)
   Life    Archea (Halophiles (salt), methanogens, and thermophiles),
           Bacteria,
           Eukarya (nuclei of organelles) animals, fungi, plants, and
              protists:
                 Plasmodium (parasite; malaria),
                 slime moulds - move eat bacteria, fungi (fungi have cilia)
                 euglena (good eye) one cell mobile with photosynthesis
                   powdered euglena: dried sardine flakes

   Homo erectus, east Asia for 2 million years - most durable species ever
   Homo florwsiensis: Flores Indonesia 3.5' max height - hobits
   Brain 2-3% body weight, uses 25% energy (apes use 8%)
     why evolution
     to lager brain? unknown...
   Upright position/Bigger brains ---> narrow hips/difficult labor
     --> premature birth --> social support --> education to anything we want
   First tools:  to break scavenged bones
   Very quick rise to top of the food chain (WO ecosystem adjustment)
     with fears and anxieties --> wars, ecological calamities ...
   Fire --> Cooking --> less time to eat, shorter intestines, bigger brains, smaller jaw/teeth
      --> power and control of environment
   1-4% European DNA is Neanderthal, 6% Australian aborigines in Denisovan
   Last Homo Neanderthal/Flores 30/12K years ago
     Sapiens is left because of his language

2. Tree of knowledge
  30K-70K years Sapiens invented bows/arrows, oil lamps, boats, needles (warm clothing)
    art - the lion man in Germany 32K years ago
      --> Cognitive Revolution; Tree of knowledge mutation? accidental...
  Green monkeys:distinct sound for "careful eagle", "careful lion"
    they look up or across...
  Sapiens: language for socializing/gossiping
    50 people --> 50!/48!/2! = 50*49/2 = 1225 one-one relationships
    gossip is essential for cooperation
    Majority of emails, phone calls, blogs, newspaper is gossip
    Historians talk about WWI when they have lunch?
      Most often about wrong-doings... gossip
      Rumor-mongers are original 4th estate;
        1 legislative, 2 executive, 3 judicial, 4 journalism
           journalism: cheat/freeloader protection
    Ability to speak about things that do not exist --> myth, religion...
      Image things collectively:
        biblical creation, Dream-time, Nationalism
         --> ability to cooperate in large numbers
        wolfs/apes do so in much smaller numbers
    Chimps:
      groups of few dozen, hierarchical, alpha male
      acknowledge alpha-male as humans acknowledge king; bow...
      contest of alpha-male is done with coalitions of other males/females
      ties kept via: hugs, kisses, grooming, favors...
        politicians: shake hands, kiss babies..
        alpha chimp maybe contested with coalitions with other males/females
          alpha wins not because of physical strength bur for coalitions
      max troop size is 40 to 50 - very rare up to 100
        genocide: one group kills most members of another
    Sapiens:
      gossip helped built larger and more stable groups
      maximum is about 150 - communities, military units, businesses...
         not need for formal ranks/titles/laws
      Exceed the 150 lint:
        appearance of fiction; believe in common myths;
        city, church, state...
        Judicial system with legal myths
        "There is no God, nations,money, human rights, laws, justice
        outside the common imagination of humans"
        Lawyers are like sorcerers with stranger tales
        A company - say Peugeot is figment of collective imagination; "legal fiction"
        In US "limited liability Co" = corporation (although companies lack body)
          treated as legal persons
      Convincing stories about god, nations, company to millions of people
         ('fictions', 'social constructs', 'imagined realities')--> immense power
         these are not lies
         lies are about facts;
           green monkey lie about lions to have food to themselves
      Cognitive revolution --> dual reality;
        physical reality (rivers, animals..) depends on grace of imagined reality
      1879 French switched from divine kings to people sovereignty overnight
        cultural revolution more adaptive than genetic evolution
        regular chimps to behave like bonobos requires genetic evolution
      Culture:
        Homo Erectus tools did not change for 2 million years; genetic not cultural
        30K yrs, Sapiens traded shells for hundred of miles, Neanderthal did not
        Pacific islanders used Obsidian glass form other island 25O miles away
        common fictions --> trust --> trade
        Sapiens hunted collectively - evidence of herd slaughters
        mythical glue to go beyond the 150 person society limit

3. A day in the life of Adam and Eve
  Evolutionary psychology: present societies, psychologies shaped pre-industrially
  'Gorging gene': instinct to eat high calorie (sweet) food.
  Collective fatherhood: people did not know if people sire by one or many fathers
    infidelity, divorces, psychological problems:
      monogamy incompatible with biological software
    Stone age is actually wood age - mostly wooden tools
  Cognitive revolution --> cultural choices
  Dogs domesticated 15K ago - before agricultural evolution (12K)
    12K old tomb - woman with puppy
  Human collective knowledge is immense
    Human individual less skillful/dexterous/knowledgeable than when foraging
    brain size decreased after agricultural revolution
  Foragers
    life more comfortable/rewarding than shepherds, labors, clerks...
    varied healthy diet (than that of farmers)
    skeleton evidence:
      taller, healthier than the peasant decedents
      less prone to starvation
      30-40 year life expectancy because of infant mortality
    good diet/health/work --> 'original affluent societies'
    but also hard;
      accident --> death sentence
      unwanted babies alder slain
      human sacrifices...
  Farmers more prone to:
    hunger via drought, floods, fire
    disease (?) (tuberculosis, measles came from domesticated animals)
    dense population to foster disease
  Ache, modern foragers in Paraguay until 1960
    valued dead elder buried with a killed little girl
    abandoned middle aged man faced vultures, recovered then
      his name became "vulture droppings"
    older women were burden, younger men snack behind killing them with ax
      "I used to kill my aunts.. now with whites I am weak..."
    babies with white hair killed
    baby killed because it was crying
    violence between adults very rare
    men/women free to change partners
    no hierarchy, smiled a lot, shunned dominant people
    generous, not obsessed with health
    killing babies/sick/elder was euthanasia
  Animism (soul or spirit)
    rock, stream, tree - can be angry, have desires needs
    spirit of dead, demons, fairies, angels
      local beings - not universal gods - particular tree...
    can communicate with all things via speech, dance, song, ceremony
    ask forgiveness from slain deer
    placate spirit that caused sickness
    world does revolve around humans or one group of beings
    generic religion
      thousand of different religions, cults & beliefs
  Theism
    pre-modern agriculturists
    universal order: hierarchical; humans a samll group of gods
    Aztecs, Jews, Christians, Muslims
  30K old burial in Sungir Russia
    boy/girl with 5,000/5,250 ivory beads, 250/0 fox teeth
       and various ivory objects
       45 min/bead --> 3 years of labor
    --> cultural beliefs: 1. leader parents, 2. identified as incarnations
       3. the way they died/sacrificed
  Peace or war
    Evidence from burial sites: 2%, 3.5%, 40% violent deaths
    Now war and crime 1.5%
    20th century 5%

4. The Flood
  45K years ago, Australia, first colonization -crossing 60+ mile channels
    Unique animals:
      450 lb 6 ft kangaroo
      Thylacoleo-marsupial lion,
      Dromornis stirtoni - flightless 1,100lb bird
      Diprotodon 3,500lb elephant-like marsupial
    Last million years:
      ice-age every 100K
      last one 70K & 30K peak
      Diprotodon disappeared 45K years ago
        90% of land mega-fauna disappeared but not any oceanic
        cause:
          lack of fear of humans
          burning forest
        Eucalyptus, tolerating fire, more widespread
        climate change contributed...
    New Zealand:
      No 45K year extinction
      Maori settle 800 years ago --> 60% mega-fauna extinct
    Wrangle island, Russia:
      Mammoths disappeared 4K ago in short time
      (10K yrs ago no mammoths anywhere else)
    Mauritius, of Madagascar
      Hindu majority - imported Indian laborers
      dodo became extinct after colonization
    American continent
      16K yrs Siberian migration
      10K Tierra del Fuego
      giant sloths extinct
      with 2K years 34/47 large mammals extinct
      evidence: poop analysis
        latest sloth poop in Cuba 7K years, when humans appeared
    Madagascar
      large animals vanished 1,500 years ago
      when humans arrived
    Similar for other Pacific islands: sapiens arrives --> extinctions
    Start of cognitive era 200 genera of large mammals
      to start of agricultural - 100 remained
    Sapiens: deadliest specie
    1/2/3 wave extinctions: foragers/farmers/industrialists
      large marine animals survived 1&2but not 3

Part II: THE AGRICULTURE REVOLUTION

5. History's biggest fraud
  Agriculture began in Turkey/Iran/Levant 9.5-8.5K BC
    wheat 9K BC, peas/lentils 8K, olives 5K, horses 4K, grapes 3.5K
  now 90% calories from:
    wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, millet, barley
       Middle east: wheat, peas 9 K BC
       Central America: maize, beans 4.5
       S. America: potato, llama 3.5
       China: rice, millet, pig 7
       N. America: Pumpkins 2
       New Guinea: sugar cane, bananas 6
       West Africa: millet, rice, sorghum, wheat 3
    cuisine is from early farmers, mind form hunters/gatherers
  fraud:
    agricultural revolution --> better diet, leisure, food security
  reality:
    less of all, less quality food &
    population explosion, pampered elites
    need to defend land (more violence)
    15/25% all/male violent deaths
      New Guinea: 30-35% male violent deaths
      Wao
      ranis in Ecuador 50%
    protection from weather
  culprits:
    plants; wheat, rice, potatoes
    wheat manipulated/domesticated sapiens
      sapiens not made for digging, & clearing rocks
              made for climbing and running
      evidence: slipped discs, arthritis, hernias
    Changes were slow - nobody noticed.
      miscalculation - no one could have foreseen the big changes
    Increased population made going back impossible
       → the trap snapped shut
    Pursuit of easier life → more hardship
      similar to current demanding jobs, family, vacations…
    History iron law:
      Luxuries become necessities
        washing machines, telephones, computers invented to make life easier
          end up making it more busy
    Few Luddite cannot stop the luxury trap - there is no going back;

    Divine intervention
      Gobekli Tepe in Turkey monuments from 9.5K BC (Stonehenge is 2.5K BC) built by hunters gathers.
        Monuments built for cultural reasons
        common religion could do that
        variant of wheat originated 20 miles from site
        people farmed so they built the monument
        Temple built first and villages grew around it.

  Victims of the Revolution
    Selective hunting --> captive animals --> select breeding
      mouflon --> fatter, submissive, less curious sheep
    1B each: sheep, pigs, >1B cattle, 25B chicken
      Evolutionary success but most miserable animals
        success is meaningless
      New Guinea:
        farms cut of part of pig's nose so that it is painful to smell
        cannot find find or move around --> dependent on humans
        other part, pigs are blinded
      Milk supply:
        1. slaughter newborn kids/calves
        2. milk mother as long as possible
        3. get mother pregnant
      Cows: live for four years as milking cows
            impregnated 60 to 120 days after giving birth (gestation is 9 months)
            impregnated 1 ear after birth
      Tribes: killed calf, stuffed, and placed new cow to encourage milk production
              make suckling painful:
                 cut of upper camel's lip
                 put sing of thorns around calf's mouth
      Exceptions to this:
        Caligula (Roman tyrant) wanted to make his horse a consul

6. Building pyramids
    Agricultural revolution:
      prosperity or perdition (eternal punishment and damnation)
      symbiosis with nature --> greed & alienation
      population 10K BC: 5-8M, 100AD: 250M
        Africa/America/Australia 1-2M hold out hunters
      farmers: attached to mouse/fields; self-centered
        more artifacts than entire hunting tribe

  The coming of the future
    concern/anxiety of future from cyclical seasons/uncertainty
    farming stress --> social/political systems
    forfeited surplus --> politics,wars, art, philosophy
                          forts, palaces, monuments
    90% peasants until recent;
       10% rulers,soldiers, priests, artisans, thinkers (fill history books)

  An imagined order
    Food surplus conflicts: distribution, storage, land, water
      for villages, towns, cities ---> famine(not always) --> war
    Çatalhöyük: first city in the world 7K BC, 5K-10K
    Akkadia of Sargon: >1M people
    Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian empires millions of people
    Qin dynasty in China 221 BC, 40M
    Roman empire 100M, 0.5M army
    "cooperation networks":
        goal: peasants produce food and build cities for the wealthy
        "imagined orders" sustained by belief on shared myths
           1. Code of Hammurabi
               deities appointed the king to make justice
                 --> list of "if this happens, this is the judgment"
                 cost of life, eye.. for:
                    men, women, superior people, commoners, slaves
               if a superior kills another superior's daughter, the first superior's
                 daughter is killed
           2. American Declaration of Independence
               universal eternal justice inspired by god
               all people are created equal by their Creator
                 (in Hammurabi all people are not equal)
           Both 1 &2 are wrong - justice is from the imagination of sapie

             According to biology people were not created but evolved
             Equality is from Christianity - all have equal souls
             "created equal" --> "evolve differently"
             "Creator endow them" --> "blind evolution evolved them"
             "unalienable rights" --> "mutable characteristics"
             "happiness" --> "pleasure"
             no liberty in biology...
     Believe (1&2) in an order to enable cooperation and built better society

  True Believers
    Voltaire: "there is no God, don't tell my servant lest he murder me"
    Sapiens does not have natural rights as chimps spiders have natural rights
    Gravity does not change, but imagined order may always collapse
      Myth enforcement via violence: army, police, prison
        "eye for an eye", civil war when majority considered blacks humans...
      Prince Talleyrand: clergy, politician, diplomat work for king and Napoleon
        (crafty cynical diplomacy)
         "you ca do a lot with bayonets but cannot sit on them"
    1 priest = 100 soldiers
    Military/violence order very difficult;
      need true belief in God, honor, motherland, manhood, money
    Cynics cannot built empire...
      "Diogenes told Alexander to move - he was blocking the sun"
    Christianity, democracy, modern economy last because of true believers

  The prison walls
    Insist that imagined order (IO) is not imagined;
    People are equal not because Jefferson said so, but because of God...
    Free markets are best not because of Adam Smith, but because of natural laws
    Imagined order(IO) reinforcement via:
      fairy tales, dramas, songs, architecture, recipes, fashions..
      rich wear blue jeans...
    Factors preventing realizing that what if effecting life is imaginary:
      1. IO embedded in physical world
         Worship individualism - if others make fun of you ignore it.
         Houses with rooms for privacy/autonomy - rock stars in wall, socks on floor
         Medieval castles - no privacy/individualism -
           east sleep with others - position in hierarchy and what others said
      2. IO shapes our desires
         cherished western desires: romantic, nationalist, capitalist, humanist myths
         "follow your heart"  "diet coke. do what feels good."
         "take holiday abroad"; romantic consumerism - pharaohs did not have it..
         A. Romanticism:
           have different experiences, emotions, relationships, food, music
           "how new experience opened my eyes and changed my life"
         B. Consumerism:
           consume goods & services to be happy; commercials remind us
         Both A & B:
           tourism industry sells experience
           fix  relationship - go on a trip
           different forms of pyramids: pool, beach view, cottage...
     3. IO is inter-subjective
        IO is not just in my imagination - it is inter-subjective order
        subjective: exists depending on individual consciousness/beliefs
                    disappears when belief changes
        inter-subjective: in communication network linking people
                          disappears if most people in network change belief
                          examples: money, law, gods, nations, human rights
                          start/maintain complex organizations
       no way out of IO; break out of jail cell run in the yard of prison

7. Memory overload
   Can play basketball with strangers because of share imaginary rules
   For nations, churches, trade networks: work with millions
   Laws customs not in genome - but must be maintained; problems:
     too large; cannot be kept in brain
     people die, information dies
     brain adapted for: botanical, zoological, topographical, social info
       needed number memory;
         Sumerians solved it with writing --> enable cities empires....

   Signed Kushim
     Sumerian symbols for 1, 10, 60, 600, 3,600, 36,000  (-->24 hr/360 degrees)
              symbols for people, places, animals, dates....
                 partial script - not for poetry...
     Incas: quipu: hundreds of colorful cords with thousands of knots
            record tax collection and ownership for 10-12M people
            Spaniards kept them and later phased them out
            few surviving quipus are undecipherable

   The Wonders of bureaucracy
     Full scripts:
       Cuneiform/hieroglyphics 2.5K BC  Chinese 1.2K BC, central America 1K BC
       Hebrew bile, Iliad, Mahabharata, Tripitaka
       Taxes & bureaucracies Siamese twins
     Scribes went to school - used catalogs, dictionaries, calendars, forms...
       used Sumerian instead of the common Akkadian language
       think as accountants (like a filing cabinet) instead as humans
     Free association & holistic thought --> categorizing & bureaucratic thought

   The language of numbers
     Arabic numbers are actually Hindu - do no look like common numbers
     Poverty, happiness, honesty expressed in numbers
     Physics engineering lost all touch with spoken language
     Binary system everything in 0/1
     Writing:
       slave --> master
       sapiens talks fells dreams in numbers which are understood by computers
       ruler:
         sapiens --> series of 0 /1

8. There in no justice in history
   How did humans organize into cooperation networks?
      1. imagined orders 2. devised scripts
      imagined order:  not neutral or fair
      "equality  of all men" - woman and blacks were not men
      Aristotle:
        slave has "slavish nature" - status reflects their innate nature
      Hindus:
        gods created world out of body of Purusa
        sun from eye, moon from brain, Brahmins (priests) from mouth,
        warriors from arms...peasants/merchants from thighs, Shudras (servants) from legs
      Chinese:
        goddess Nu Wa created aristocrats from yellow soil, commoners from brown mud
      Current:
        blacks should not be discriminated,
        rich/poor discrimination is OK

  The vicious circle
    Indian cast, Ottoman religion, American race
      type base on historical accident
    Hindu cast system invented by Indo-Aryan invaders
     inter-cast marriage, sharing meals prohibited
     purity/impurity essential elements
       purity(health) comes from biological survival mechanisms
       to isolate women, black, gays, Roma, Jews label them pollutants
       new group or profession of people
          --> new cast; 3,000 sub-casts (jati [birth])
       people without a cast --> untouchables (Dalits ["broken/scattered"])

  Purity in America
    Importation of millions of slaves from Africa:
      1. Africa closest
      2. Africa already a slave trade (exporting mostly to middle east)
      3. American plantation plagued by malaria and yellow fever
         blacks had partial genetic immunity
      ruling white Europeans/subjugated black Africans
        religious myth:blacks were descendants of Ham cursed by his father Noah
        science myths: blacks less intelligent than whites
                       black spread diseases
        after freedom of slaves (1865),
          blacks still considered source of violence, theft, rape, and disease
          Jim Crow laws: segregation backed by 'scientific' studies
        black that applied to white university (1958) was committed to mental asylum
        black man + white woman --> KKK lynching
       Aesthetic culture: light skin, straight hair, small upturned nose...
       Vicious cycles for centuries or millennia:
         money comes to money, same for poverty, education, ignorance
         victims more likely to be victims
         privileged ...
      Reasons to study history:
        hierarchies are no logical or biological
        perpetuation of chance events supported by myths
        understand by studying:
          events, circumstances, power relations
           that transformed imaginations in cruel social structures

  He and She
    Gender hierarchy common to all societies
    In China 3K years ago and in child Communist rule, families preferred boys
    women were property of fathers/husbands/brothers
    Rape:
      Bible: man pays the owner and gets victim as wife
      husband raping wife: oxymoron
      no crime if woman does not belong to anyone
      1997 German law for marital rape
    Ancient Athens:
      women excluded from politics philosophy...
      homosexuality not taboo;
         Achilles & Patroclus  of Alexander the great & Hepaestion
    'Biology enables and culture forbids'
      natural according to Christian theology
    Chimps use sex for political alliance and to defuse tensions

  Sex and gender
    Myths define gender roles, rights, duties
    Now dominant men dress dull - for first time ever
    Sex/gender are biological/cultural
    Man/women prove/convince their muscularity/femininity

  What is so good about men?
    Men in all societies valued more; Patriarchal societies across continents
    Exceptions: Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, Wu Zetian of China 700 AD
    Biological reason for patriarchies?
      no convincing theories;
      1. muscle power
         men control food production, have more clout
         but: women excluded from non-physical jobs
                    have more stamina
              generally there is no relation of human strength and social power
              social skills more important than strength, age...
              alpha chip is best to form coalitions....
              mental and social skills (not strength) of sapiens placed them on top
      2. aggression
         men evolved to fight wars
         men fighting does not mean that management & benefits of wars need to be by men
         soldiers controlled by male aristocrats
         Chinese: 'do not waste good iron(bureaucrats/ware managers) to make nails(soldiers)'
         women have better social skills to be managers than men...
      3. patriarchal genes
         men compete to get women
         women need help and became more submissive
         but bonobo monkeys & elephants are matriarchal
    Cause of patriarchy is unknown
    But recently has changed dramatically

9. The arrow of history
   Culture == network of artificial instincts
     enabled millions to cooperate
     set of norms, beliefs, values.. that are in constant flux
       changes via 1. environment
                   2. contact with other cultures
                   3. resolution of internal conflicts
     internal conflict example:
       1. Chivalry: better to die than live in shame
         Christianity: turn the other cheek
           never fully resolved
           but culture changed as people tried to resolve it
           resolution attempts: crusades
             Templars, Hospitallers. legends of King Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere
       2. modern political order
          French revolution 1789 --> social equality & individual freedom
            --> contradiction of equality/freedom
            Dickens novels: freedom at expense of poverty...
            Solzhenitsyn: brutality of Communist equality
            Democrats: equitable society & infringement of freedom of spending ones money
            Republicans: maximize freedom at the expense of wider wealth gap
     Conflict: engine of cultural development
       all great works of art are about conflict
       cognitive dissonance: is not failure but asset;
         no contradictory beliefs --> no culture
       to understand Muslim culture, learn their catch-22s not their pristine values

  The spy satellite
    Is cultural flux not random; does history have direction?
      Yes: simple cultures coalesce to bigger ones (on macro level)
           not visible from centuries perspective
    Cosmic spy satellite millennia perspective:
      Separate human worlds:
        Tasmania isolated from Australia for 12K years
        Ancient Rome,
        Mayan city states
        20KBC: thousands
        2KBC: hundreds
        1450: 1. Afro-Asia-Europe (90%)
              2. Meso-American; collapsed 1521
              3. Andean; collapsed 1532
              4. Australian; collapsed 1788 (discovered 1606)
              4. Oceanic - Pacific islands; Hawaii--> New Zealand
                (from Zeeland - dutch region in Netherlands, not for Zealand in Denmark)
     Afro-Asian world (entire planet):
       capitalist market forces
       legal system of theoretical human rights & international law
       scientific system
     There is no clash of civilization (dialogue of the deaf)
       current enemies use the same language of economy, science....
     No authentic (independent) cultures
       in few hundred years cultures changed beyond recognition
     Globalization:
       Ethnic cuisine: Italian: tomatoes spaghetti
                       Polish/Irish: potatoes
                       Argentine: beef
                       Indian: hot chilies with anything
       All are not native; tomatoes/chilies Mexican, beef Afro-Asian....
       Indians fought with horses
         horses were not native - part of the modern culture
     Practical global unification:
       last few centuries
       large empires and increased trade
     Ideological unification:
       1K BC idea of global universal orders:
         1. economic monetary order; merchants - only customers
         2. imperial; conquerors - one planet
         3. religious; prophets - one truth
       (transcendence of binary us versus them)

10. The scent of money
  Money succeeds where gods & kings fail
  Aztecs asked Cortes why gold is important, reply:
    "we suffer from heart disease which is only cured with gold"
  300 years before Cortes:
    Victor Christians minted gold coins with cross & millares coin with Allah
    Muslims accepted gold coins with or without cross

  How much is it?
    Up to small scale agriculture:
      exchange goods via barter (limited range of products)
      Barter of 100 goods:
        100!/2!(100-2)! = 100*999/2 = 50*999 = 49,950 exchange rates
        for 1,000 goods: 499,500 exchange rates
    Cities, kingdoms --> labor, locality specializations
      --> problem of exchanging goods
      Solutions:
        1. Central barter experiment in Soviet Union
           'Working according to abilities and receive according to needs'
            Similar system in Inca empire
        2. money

    Shells and cigarettes
      money, like agriculture, independently invented in multiple places
      Money:
        shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth, IOUs
        Cowry shells: Africa, Asia, Oceania for 4K years
          in British Uganda up to 1900
          Canadian Indians used them in ceremonies
          shells found mostly in Indian ocean
        Cigarettes: POWs in Auschwitz
          loaf of bread:   12 cigarettes
          10 oz margarine: 30
          watch:           80
          quart alcohol:  400
      All money in world 60 trillion; coins/notes: 6 trill.
        90% >50 trill. are only in computers
      Everyone wants money because everyone else wants money
        Universal medium of converting everything into something else:
          Brawn into brain (soldier uses education benefits)cowrie
          Land to loyalty (selling land to support servants)
          Health to justice (doctor hires lawyer)
          Sex to salvation (1400s prostitutes brought Catholic indulgences)
      Money stores wealth but not time or beauty
        Enables complex networks & dynamic markets

  How does money work
    Money is psychological construct;
      the most universal and efficient system of mutual trust ever
      Trust --> finance is linked to political, social and ideological systems
    First money:
      Sumerian barley money 3,000BC (same as writing)
        sila = 1 quart
          male/female laboror 60/30 silas/month
          foreman 1.2K-5K silas/month
        difficult to store and transport
      Money WO inherent value: silver shekel - 0.3 oz (not a coin)
        Pay 20 silver shekels fro killing a slaves wife- 6 oz of silver
        Joseph sold for 20 shekels..
        silver value is cultural - silver jewelry...
      First coin 640 BC by Alyattes of Lydia
        standard weight and issuer
        solved weight/authenticity problems
        trust on dollar is trust on USA
      Roman denarius coin:
        3.9 g of silver. later 3 g
        =10 asses copper coins, later 16 asses
          as: assārius‎ ("of an as")
        25 denari = 1 nummus aureus (“gold money”), or
                    1 denarius aureus
        enabled taxation ... maintained the empire

  Gospel of gold
    Strong trust in Roman coins:
      100 AD accepted in India,
      Indians made copies of the coins
      Arabs adopted & named it dinar - in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia
    China:
      bronze coins & silver/gold ingots
    Late modern era:
      gold, silver, pound, dollar universal money
      --> global economic unification
          with different languages/religions
      --> gold from Americas enabled trade with East Asia
          not possible if Chinese did not suffer same "disease of the heart" as Spaniards

  Why common belief in gold?
    (and disagreement in everything else)
    answer: when trade connects 2 areas, supply/demand equalize transportable goods
      gold demand in Europe makes gold go up in India where it may be very low
    The belief in bit coin, makes us believe the people that use it.
    Religion asks to believe in something
      Moneys asks to believe that others believe in something
    Money is root of all evil, but:
      more open minded than:
        language, laws, cultures codes, religious beliefs, social habits
      does not discriminate
      enables cooperation with total strangers

  The price of money
    Money base on universal:
      1. convertibility; money is alchemist
          turns justice to health, violence to knowledge...
      2. trust;
           money in between any two people can cooperate
    Cost:
      human values (honor, loyalty, morality, love)
      replaced with supply/demand
        children should be sold to slavery
        mortal sins should not be committed
          (lust, gluttony, avarice, sloth, anger, envy and pride)
        ancestral land should be sold to foreigners
    Money dark side:
      slavery, buy forgiveness, sell land (identity)...
    Darker side:
      trust is about money itself not the humans
      money brings down dams of community, religion, state
         --> world: heartless marketplace
    People destroy dams the hod movement of money
      AND build dams to protect society, religion environment..
    Naive to think markets always prevail;
      warriors,fanatics, concerned citizens have reshaped economies
    Unification of humankind is no just economic
      Steel is as important as gold....

II Imperial visions
  Numantia in Spain repelled Romans  50 BC
    134 BC Rome sent Scipio Aemilianus (leveled Carthage) with 30K troop
      1 year siege: hunger did the work
        Numantia burned their houses and killed themselves
    --> symbol of Spanish independence
      in art literature, comic books in 1950/60s in Spanish Romance language
        but Numantias spoke Celtic which originate in central Europe
        story is known only because of Roman historians
  No just in history;
    most past cultures were obliterated by a ruthless empire
    Empires fall but they leave something behind
      We are all offspring of one empire or another

  What is Empire?
    1. rule over distinct peoples/cultures >~10
    2. flexible borders - can swallow more without changing
       100 years ago any place could have become part of British empire
    Able to unite diverse ethnic groups and ecological zones
    Defined NOT by origin, government, or size
      Athenian began as a league
      Hapsburg from marriage alliances
      British ruled by democracy
        Other democratic: Dutch, French, Belgian, American, Athenian,
           Novgorod (north Russia/Baltic), Rome, Carthage
      Athenian was tiny, but gobbled hundreds of different cities
      Aztec small but ruled 371 tribes
      In past there were a lot more tribes/ethnic groups
    Empires have reduced human diversity

  Evil Empires?
    Imperialist 2nd to fascist as bad
    Critiques:
      1. Empires do not work
          (historical non-sense)
      2. the should form because they bring destruction and exploitation
    Empires:
      most common government in last 2.5K years
      form of stable government
      toppled only by outsiders or internal power class split
      conquered cultures slowly cease to exist
    When Rome was conquered in 476 AD,
      people conquered before had forgotten their language....
    Destruction of one empire --> another empire (not freedom)
      example middle east passed around empires for 3K years
      when British collapsed, people first conquered by Assyrians had disappeared
      Jews, Armenians, Georgians are an exaggerated exception
      King David in a modern synagogue, surprised by:
       clothes, German dialect (Yiddish), Talmud (Babylonian test), Torah
    Empire building/maintaining:
      wars, enslavement, deportation, genocide
      Roman historian Tacitus
        Made up Caledonian (Scottish) ruler Calgacus, and his speech:
        "To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire;
         and where they make a desert, they call it peace."
      To call all empires evil is to reject most of human culture.
      Empires supported philosophy, art, justice, charity
        provided the leisure of thinkers...
        Taj Mahal could be built WO Mughal exploitation of Indians
        Hungarians, Romanians, Slavs under Habsburg empire paid Hayden/Mozart
      Most pf us speak think and dream in imperial languages
        that was forced on our ancestors;
        Souteast Asia: Mandarin from the Han empire
        N./S. America: English/French/Spanish/Portuguese
        Egypt: Arabic, Egyptians see themselves as Arabs
        Zulus in S. Africa: most are descents from tribes that Zulus conquered

  It's for your own good
    Akkadian empire of Sargon (2,250 BC):
      After Sargon, Assyrian, Babylonians, Hittites used Sargon as a role model
      (they too conquered the whole world)
    Persian of Cyrus (550BC):
      "we conquering you for your own good"
      Cyrus helped Jews built their temple in Judea;
         Persian king wanting also to be king of the Jews
         Counter to evolution's we vs them; for example:
           Dinka in Sudan means people, Nuer (enemies of Dinka) means 'original people'
           Yapik (Siberia) means 'real people'
      After Cyrus, humankind see as a family;
         privilege of parent goes with responsibility
         Benevolent vision:
         Cyrus --> Alexander --> Hellenistic kings --> Roman emperors
           --> Muslim caliphs --> Indian dynasts --> Soviet premiers, American Presidents
      Benevolent vision in China:
        Heaven (Tian) mandate enables rulers
        a legitimate (mendated) authority is always universal
        1st Chinese emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi:
          'all in universe, on every human footprint, belongs to emperor...
           his kindness even reaches oxen and horses... all benefit and all are safe'
        Chines political/historical thinking:
          imperial ages == golden ages
          when empire collapsed, theory goaded powers to try unification
        Western idea:
          independent states == justice

  When they become us
    Empires spread culture; ideas, people, goods technology,to:
      1. make it easier for themselves
      2. gain legitimacy - from war to road-building, conquered gained more
    Benefits: law, planing, standard measures
              not so: taxes, conscription, emperor worship....
      China: Mandate of Haven required emperor to educate humanity
      Romans: peace, justice, and refinement for the barbarians
      Mauryan (India) 300 BC spread Buddhism
      Muslims spread Islam peaceful or forceful if necessary
      Spanish/Portuguese: sought converts to new faith
      British: spread liberalism  (development & civilization) and free trade
      Soviets facilitate switch from Capitalism to Utopian dictatorship of the proletariat
        proletariat/bourgeoisie: ('producing offspring')/('town dweller')
      America:  bring democracy & human rights to 3-rd world countries
        even if by force
    Most Empires adopted from conquered;
      Roman culture was Greek as much as Roman
      Abbasid (Arab Golden age): was Persian, Greek, Arabic,
      Mongol: Chinese copy-cat
      America: president with Kenyan roots, likes Italian pizza, Lawrence
        of Arabia (British story about Arabs)
    Assimilation was painful and traumatic
      Conquered peoples adoption to acceptance took decades to centuries
        (acceptance: elite accepts 'them' as 'us')
      Gandhi got a law degree, dressed like and Englishman
        but was thrown out of train in South Africa when he tried to travel 1st class
    200 AD Roman rulers descendant from Iberia
      then had Libyan, Syrian emperors, 'Phillip the Arab' 244-9
    Arab Empire: Arabs versus non-Muslim
       Egyptians, Syrians, Iranians, Berbers (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia)
         eventually they saw themselves as Arabs
         and Iranians, Turks, Berbers dominated the Arabs
    China Empire : barbarians incorporated into empire: the Hans (in the Han empire)
      now empire intact, and 90% of Chinese see themselves as Han
    Last fee decades: Africans, Arabs, Chinese, Maoris learned English Spanish...
       adopted West ideologies  Capitalism Communism....
       anti-colonial struggles used these ... according to their needs & traditions....

  Good guys and bad guys in history
    Most empires founded on blood;
      but not all were bad
    Most of today's cultures are from imperial legacies
      all empires cannot be bad
    Anti-imperialism school:
      purge all imperialism & leave pure civilization without sin
      this: naive at best
            bigoted at worst; there is no culture without sin
    Example: India versus British Raj (king)
       British conquest: millions of Indian lives & more mullions humiliated/exploited
         but Indians adopted self-determination, human rights
             gained shared national consciousness, built railroads, legal system...
         Previous Indian empire was no less brutal
         If all British buildings were to be destroyed what about Taj Mahal?
         Question of cultural inheritance is thorny...
         If we have past with good and bad guys, then we must admit that
         we followed that bad buys.

  New global empire
    Since 200BC most have lived in empires.
    In future most we live in one;
      Common interest & culture ruled by multi-ethnic elite
    Current 200 inter-dependent states
      Cultural trends spread instantly - music, movies, food
      Multi-ethnic professional class (same language, views, interests) forms above the state
      Share global problems - climate, pollution,bio-engineering, AI, new life forms
      Global cooperation is required
        peacefully, via war.
      All empires since Cyrus the great(600BC) promised promised and failed to help all
      No empire was universal

12. The law of religion
   Religion 3rd unifier of humans
     more durable than money/empire; superhuman legitimacy to imagined hierarchies
   Religion == human norms and values founded on belief of superhuman order
     1. entire system of norms/values
        reincarnation is no this, hence is not religion
     2. based on superhuman laws instead of human decisions
        soccer has rules but is not a religion
     2. Universal and missionary; after 1,000BC
        for example: Islam/Buddhism
        old religions: local and exclusive

  Silencing the labs
    Animism:
      human norms/values took into account animals, plants, ghosts...
      very local in outlook,
      understanding of the superhuman order of environment for survival
    Hunters:
      Hunting wild animals did not make them inferior;
      Being hunted by tigers did not make tigers superior
    Farmers:
      owned animals - no need to negotiate with possessions
      first religions did not have animals/plants on equal spiritual footing
      problem: how to ensure fertility/health of animals/plants?
      solution: Fertility goddess, health god, sky god
         --> ancient mythology:
              humans promise devotion to gods
              in exchange for the mastery over animals
              sacrifice of animals/wine/cakes for abundant harvest
              Trade increase --> rocks, springs, demons... replaced by other gods
    Animism ---> Polytheism (Animist spirits persisted but were less powerful)
    Animists:
      humans were one of many creatures
    Polytheists:
      world is a reflection of relationship of gods and people;
      Prayers, sins, good deeds determine fate of everything;
      Few sapients angered the gods and there was a big flood...
      Gods/humans exalted everything else muted decor...lambs silenced

  Benefits of Idolatry
    Polytheism seen as childish is from 2K years exposure to monotheism
    Both polytheism and animism admit to single power;
      Zeus, Apollo... were subject to Moira
      Nordic gods subject to fate, Urðr
      Yoruba in West Africa, gods born from Olodumare
      Hindu, myriad of gods from Atman (Self)
      -->supreme power is unconcerned with humans; (THE MAIN INSIGHT)
         no Moira or Atman temples;
           Adhus Hindus: renounce all desires embrace all and devote to Atmain
           Stoics: Accept the things to which fate binds you
    Polytheism:
      insight: supreme power unconcerned with humans
      tolerant - accepts more gods..
      open minded; no heretics or infidels
    Empires did not spread polytheism;
      Egyptians/Romans/Aztecs did not spread Osiris/Jupiter/Huitzilopochtli
        Osiris: fertility, agriculture, dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation
        Jupiter: sky and thunder, and king of the gods
        Huītzilōpōchtli ("the left (or south) side of the hummingbird"):
          war, sun, human sacrifice, patron of Tenochtitlan-city/Mexicas-tribe
      Adopted local gods; Romans/Greeks adopted Cybele (Phrygian mother-goddess)
          & Isis (daughter of Osiris, mother of first pharaoh; goddess of health)

    Romans did not require Christians to give up their beliefs
      but expected political royalty; respect for protector gods and emperor
      Christians refused & persecution began;
      In 300 years only 4 persecutions - a few thousand Christians
        Next 1,500 years Christians killed millions of other Christians
        for slightly different interpretation of love...
    Catholic/Protest war:
      Protestant: God was incarnated in flesh redeeming the original sin
      Catholic: same and tone must attend church rituals and do good deeds
        Protestants: additional is a quid pro quo that belittles God's love'
          favor expected in return for something
          "whoever thinks entry to heaven depends on deeds magnifies their importance"
    St. Bartholomew massacre
      Aug. 23 1572, France 5K-10K protestants slaughtered in 24 hours
        ***** more than the Romans in their entire existence *****
      Pope organized a festival and decorated a room with a fresco of the massacre
    1562 to 1598 French Wars of Religion
        --> 8%-10% decline population
    Benefits of Idolatry?:
      less violence

  God is One
    Fondness a particular patron god --> drift way from polytheism
      Particular god became all  powerful and only god
    Egypt 1st monotheism:
      1350 Pharaoh Akhenaten declared Aten (sun god) supreme ruler
         lasted briefly ..
    Local monotheism:
      Judaism - God's chief interest was on the obscure land of Israel
    Christianity:
      Jewish sect tried to  convince Jews that Jesus was their messiah
      Paul of Tarsus (Paul the Apostle) %AD-65AD:
        realized the need to spread the gospel;
          supreme power incarnated and died on the cross for all humans
    Christianity success--> model for Islam
      small sect created immense empire from Atlantic to India
    Monotheism
     last 2K years violently tied to eliminate competition
     500AD Roman empire was Christian
     1,000ADEurope, West Asia, North America Empires ordained by single God.
     Today all outside east Asia, and theworld political order
       built on monotheistic foundations
     Belief that supreme power has interests and biases;
       what it the point to worshiping partial powers?
       yet polytheism continued with monotheism;
     Monotheism expelled gods through the front door
       and took them back from the side window;
         --> Christian pantheon of saints
     Jupiter defended Rome, Huitzilopochtli Aztecs  -\-->
       one patron saint for each kingdom
       St George England
       St Andrew Scotland
       St Stephen Hungry
       St Martin France
       St Ambrose Milan
       St Mark Venice
      for headaches St Agathius, toothaches St Apollonia
      chimney cleaners St Florian
      Celtic chief goddess in Ireland: Brigid
        After Christianization --> St Brigid

  Battle of good and evil
    Dualist religions:
      evil is independent power neither create by or subordinate to God
        Simple answer to the 'problem of evil';
        problem: 'Why is there evil?, suffering?, bad things happen to good people?'
        answer:  'If no evil, no free will'
            freedom allow humans to choose evil
    If God knew someone would choose evil and
      then punished why did he create them?
      Monotheists: hard time with it
      Dualists: easy- evil is an independent power
          but has problem or order - who enforces the good/evil struggle laws?
    Monotheism:
      explain order, puzzled wiht evil
    Dualism:
      explains evil, puzzled by order
   Zoroastrianism 1.5k-1K BC:
     main dualistic religion
     good/evil gods Ahura-Mazda/Angra-Mainyu
     in Persian empire 550-330 BC
     inspired
       1. Gnosticism (material existence is flawed or evil) and
       2. Manichaenism (primeval conflict between light and darkness)
          originally more widespread than Christianity
     for both:
       good/bad god created the soul/body
       man serves as battleground of good (soul) versus evil (body)
       this became Christian/Muslim cornerstone
       similar for heaven/hell;
         old testament does not have neither soul life after death
   Monotheism adopted dualism:
     Jewish/Christian/Islamic belief on evil force
     Humans accommodate contradictions;
       Jews/Christians/Muslims imagine that God needs are help to fight the Devil
          --> jihad/crusade inspirations
   Historical monotheism:
     kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist, animist legacies
     Average Christian believes in:
       monotheistic god, dualist devil, polytheistic saint, animist ghost
      --> syncretism (opposite of fundamentalism)
        adoption of contradicting idea, combination of of rituals

  The laws of nature
    1,000BC religions WO god;
      India: Buddhism “Suffering”; everyone  “Origin of suffering”
      China: Daoism; Tao: source of everything and underlying principle of reality
                     achieve perfection through self-cultivation
             Confucianism; response to Buddhism and Taoism
                           regards "the secular as sacred"
                           renaissance by academics in China
      Mediterranean: Stoicism: "virtue is the only good" for human beings
                     Cynicism: purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature
                     Epicureanism: atomic materialism; tranquility and freedom from fear
                                   and absence of bodily pain
    Super human order in the world is from natural laws not from divine will
    Some admitted existence of god but subject to natural laws as humans/animals/plants
    Buddhism central figure:
      Siddhartha Gautama, 500BC, Himalayan king
        sensitive to universal anxiety, frustration in everyone
        how to escape the pointless rat-race?
        29 years old, after 6 year mediation:
          cause of suffering caused by one's mind;
          no matter the experience, mind reacts with craving
            when bad, mind craves to eliminate it
            when good, mind craves for permanence and more of it
            dream years of true love, and never satisfied when we find it
            even kings are doomed...
          to exit the circle, accept pain, joy;
          experience reality without craving -
          focus on what you experience instead of what you rather...
          Nirvana (extinguishing fire): no craves; contentment
            no craving/desire --> no suffering
          --> Buddha ('the enlightened one')
          Dharma law: 1. suffering comes from craving; like E=mc2
                      2. only way to escape suffering is to have no craving,
                      3. only way to escape craving is to train
                         the mind to experience reality as it is
          Dharma: "righteousness", "merit" or "religious and moral duties"
                  governing individual conduct
    God exists, what does he want from me?
       --> Suffering exists, how do I escape it?
    99% of Buddhists do not attain nirvana so they continue to worship
      Hind, Bon (Tibet platue), Shinto (Japan, polytheistic and animistic)
      or a human and non-human pantheon of Buddhas & bodhisattvas
       (being who is able to reach nirvana but delays out of compassion to save suffering beings);
       they help to get nirvana or rain, stop plagues, winning wars...
       in exchange of prayers, flowers, incense or candy

  The worship of man
    New natural-law religions:
      Communism, Capitalism, nationalism, Nazism (national social.), liberalism
      - more bloodshed than previous religious wars
      The do not like to be called religions they prefer ideologies.
        -- moot semantic exercise, if religion is a system of human norms/values
        Communism is a religion as Islam
          commissars/manifesto instead of priests/scripture ...
        Buddhism gives short shrift to gods - is superhuman not supernatural...
    Buddhist can believe in Hindu gods
    Monotheist believe in Satan
    Typical American believes in:
      1. nationalism (America's special role in history)
      2. capitalism (competition is best way to create prosperity)
      3. liberal humanism (creator has given humans inalienable rights)
    Theist/humanistic religions sanctify gods/humans
    Humanism: sapiens in unique and sacred in nature
              other being exist for benefit of sapiens
              sanctifies humanity - but humanity has different definitions
      1. Liberal humanism (most import now):
        liberty of individuals is sacrosanct,
        sacred nature of humanity is in every single human;
        have a moral or political problem? listen to our inner voice....
          commandments == human rights; no torture no death penalty
        Pre-liberalism:
          criminals torture and executed publicly to restore cosmic order
        Current liberalism:
          human punishment - right what murder has wronged
        Source:
          Christian monotheism
        commandment:
          protect individual freedom
     2. Socialist humanism:
       humanity collectively than individualistic
       freedom --> equality
        Source:
          monotheism - all are equal before God
        commandment:
          protect equality within all humans
     3. Evolutionary humanism
        Nazis: most famous supporters
        unlike 1 & 2: not based on monotheism
                      humanity not universal or eternal
          humanity: can evolve or degenerate
          Nazis: prevent degeneration
            Aryans (Indo-Iranian) fostered; evolve to new advanced specie?
            Jews, Rom,a, homosexuals, mentally ill exterminated
         commandment:
           prevent degeneration and foster evolution to superhumans
        Racism
          1933 Western scholars published studies of white superiority
            America, Britain, Australia restricted non-white immigration.
          Extreme Nazi racism slowly discredited racism
            (not the newer scientific evidence)
            White supremacy remained mainstream until 1960's
            Australian immigration changed in 1966
          Nazis inspired by Darwin fought 1 & 2 because they admired humanity
            and believed in human potential;
            Liberals & Communists gave unfit person chance to reproduce
              undermined natural selection
            1942 German biology textbook:
              all being locked into remorseless struggle for survival;
              "Battle for life is hard but it is only way to maintain life...
               It eliminates everything unfit and selects survivors...
               Natural laws are incontrovertible (indisputable),
                 those that resist them are wiped out...
               Biology tells us about animals & plants and how to live our lives.
               Meaning of life is struggle.
             Mein Kampf:
               "He who fights laws of nature fights the principles that he must
                thank for his life as human....
                To fight against nature is to bring one's own destruction"
          Humanism-evolution link: taboo 60 years after Nazis
            Now it is back; no extermination; only improvements
          Liberal-humanism/biology gap:
            Life sciences last 200 years undermined Christian belief in soul;
              behavior determined by hormones, genes, synapses instead of free will
              ---> Political/judicial sweeping under the rug;
                   Artificial wall between biology, law and political sciences

13. The secret of success
   Commerce + empires + universal religion ---> current globalism
   Many small cultures ---> few large cultures ---> global culture
   But why:
     English instead of Danish?
     Christians/Muslims and no Zoroastrians?
     Monotheism and little dualism?

  1. Hindsight fallacy
     One road from past to present.
     Infinite roads from present to future.
     Constantine after a century of civil war choose Christianity
       Can never know why - causal
       Can only describe how - description of events
     Some historians:
       deterministic explanations via biology ecology economics
     But the more you know something the harder it is to explain why.
       People that know best (alive at the time) are most clueless;
       Now: Will there be a large global economic crisis?
            Will China become a superpower?
            Will USA loose the hegemony?
            Is monotheistic fundamentalism here to stay?
            Are we heading for ecological disaster or technological paradise?
              (Climate change imbalance?)
       In few decades people will say that it was obvious...
     The current unlikely possibilities are often realized;
       At 306 Constantine became emperor, suggesting that Christianity
         will be the state religion when  was outrageous.
       At 1913, could not predict that Bolsheviks would take over in 4 years.
       At 600AD could predict that a small band of Arabs would create a large empire
     Determinism:
       world and our beliefs are natural and inevitable result of history
       if not deterministic,
         nationalism, capitalism, human rights are coincidences
     Chaotic systems:
       Level 1: chaos does not react to predictions about it;
                - the weather
       Level 2: chaos reacts to predictions about it;
                Markets (price react to forecasts)
                Politics- fall of the Soviet Union, rise of Arab spring
                History - interactions are so complex;
                          small disturbance --> large effect
     Why study history?
       Not for predictions
       Understand that current situation is not natural or inevitable
       Realize that we more possibilities than we can imagine

  2. Blind Clio (muse of history)
     Do not know why monotheism..., but we know:
       History 's choices are not the benefit of humans;
       No Proof that:
         cultures that benefit humans succeed
         Christianity was better choice than Manichaeism
            (dualistic with Christian, Gnostic, and pagan elements)
            "Manichaean paranoia": that USA is with light and enemies with darkness
         Arab Empire more beneficial than Sassanid Persia (the golden empire)
         No proof because no scale of benefit;
           Definition of benefit:
             depend on culture,
             given by victors - why believe them?

    Culture:
      mental infection or parasite,
      like virus,
      cultural idea: Christian heave above clouds
                     Communist paradise on earth
        can compel one to spread it until he dies
          human dies and idea keeps spreading
        Cultures are not conspiracies (as Marxist think),
          but mental parasites that emerge randomly and take advantage of
          all the people that are infected by them
          ---> Memetics: study of information and culture
          Most scholars see it as a rude biological analogy.
          but adhere to its twin sister postmodernism
  Postmodernism
    (distrust of grand modern 20th century theories and ideologies)
    Nationalism: deadly plague in 19 & 20-th centuries causing wars,
                 hate and genocide.
                 One country infected, next country got infected.
    Nationalist virus presented itself as being beneficial for humans,
      but it was beneficial to itself.
    Game theory: in a multi-player system, views and behavior pattern that harm
                 all players, take root and spread.
           example: Arms race bankrupts all who play without changing
                    military balance.
                    Arms race, a behavior pattern, spread itself like a virus
                    harming everyone and benefits itself according to evolutionary
                    criteria of survival and reproducibility.
                    Arms race like a gene has no awareness.
    Whatever the name: game-theory/postmodernism/memetics, dynamics of history
      are for the benefit of humans;
      The most successful culture is not the best for humans.
    Humans too weak and ignorant to influence history.
    1500 AD: Scientific Revolution; change the fate of humans and life on earth.
      Why in Europe and not in China, why not sooner or later?
        Dozen of non-convincing theories - we do not know.

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION

14. Discovery of ignorance
   1500AD 500M/$250B/13T, 2023 8B/$95T/1,500T (x15/x400/x120) world population/GDP/Cal/day
   5:29:45 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo New Mexico first nuclear explosion
     Humans capable of ending history
   Pre 1500, king gave money to priests, philosophers, and poets
     to legitimize his rule and maintain social order.
   Last 500, rich people and governments fund science and research for gains;
     government funds nuclear energy --> cheap electricity --> more production
       --> more collected taxes --> more funding;
     Feedback loop:
       power --> resources --> research ---> power....

  Ignoramus
    Modern science:
      1. willingness to admit ignorance
         Science is based on 'we do not know'.
         No idea, theory is sacred beyond challenge.
      2. Observation/math is central
         To gain knowledge and create new theories.
      3. Acquire new power (technologies)
    Starting point: Admit ignorance to most important questions
    Before: Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism:
            Everything important in the world is known.
            Tradition:
              Inconceivable the Koran, Bible, Vedas was missing a crucial fact.
              2 types of ignorance:
                1. individual ignorance; ask someone wiser
                2. ignorance or unimportant things
                   (not in scripture? - not important)
                   if something new discovered it was trivia;
                     not necessary for prosperity and salvation;
                     not relevant to fundamental truth, politics, economics
            Some people: some important things are not in scriptures
                         (persecuted, marginalized)
            Muhammed followers called him "the seal of the Prophets"
            Darwin never call himself "the seal of biology"
    Established theories can change with new evidence
    Serious problem:
      Admission of ignorance extends to shared myths that enable cooperation;
      How can society, countries, international order be stabilized?
        1. Pick a scientific theory and declare it final
           (Nazis/Communists did it)
        2. Leave science out - live with a non-scientific absolute truth
           (Liberal Humanists; nothing to do with Anthropology)
        Both are unscientific; no surprise;
           but science gets funding from religious/ideologies.
      Modern social order holds because of religious-like belief
        in technology and research (wish has partially replaced shared myths)

  The scientific dogma
    No dogma, share methods to collect data.
    Theory construction with math;
      General laws in scripture given by narrative, for example:
      Manichaen religion: world is battleground of good and evil.
                          good created souls, evil created matter
                          Mani did not calculate force = acceleration of spirit
                            divide by mass of his body.
      Newton "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" 1687:
        explain and predict motion of apples, planets... fro 2 laws:
        1. sum of forces = zero or
        2. sum of forces = ma
        3. force of A on B = force of B on A
        Book of nature is written in math
    Biology, economy, psychology is written in statistics
    Scottish clergymen Webster & Wallace (1744) with mathematician MacLaurin:
      set up life-insurance;
      to find how much to set the payments, need to find out:
        1. how many minister die  2. how many orphans/widows left
        3. how may years widows outlived their husbands
      discovered
        Law of Large numbers (Bernoulli)
        cannot predict 1 event, but can accurately predict average
        930 clergy, 27 die each year
        time before widow remarriage, or death
        pay £2/yr, get £10/yr life benefits
        predicted by 1765 fund would have £58,348, and had £58,347
        --> prophecy better than Habakkuk, Jeremiah
        --> Scottish Widows - one of largest pension/insurance CO in the world
    Malthus: similar demographics; used by Darwin (almost became pastor)
    Even physics updated theory with probability clouds of quantum mechanics.
    Medieval education: logic, grammar, rhetoric, for science theology
        and sometimes esoteric math (arithmetic & geometry) - no statistics
    Now: few study rhetoric, logic merged with philosophy, theology into seminars
         all study math, and sciences that use math -linguistics, psychology...
    To understand human mind, must study statistics

  Knowledge is power
    Francis Bacon 1620: Knowledge is power
      Typical 100% correct; not relevant if knowledge is true
      relevant if theory enables us to do new things (power)
      --> connected science & tech.
      pre-1900s: no government/business support for science
                 education for supporting social order
      1900s: science/tech inseparable
             education mostly for science/tech
    Science: new mental tools - predict death rate
             new technological tools
        Science/tech confusion: no new tech WO new science
                                science research --> new tech
    Eisenhower warned of government-military power should have warned of
               government-military-science
               (military support most of science research)
    WWI bogged down - science produce aircraft, poison gas, submarines,
                      tanks, machine guns, rifles, bombs.....
    WWII 1944 Germany:
      V-2 did not defeat Britain - made Germans wait for a technological miracle
    Fear of extended war --> use of atomic bomb
    Belief of eliminating terrorism with technology:
      send robotic flies to every cave hideout...
      read terrorists' minds
      --> fund robotics & brain research
    Previous wars fought/lost via organizational advantage
      Rome had best organized army but no better technology
      Loosers sometimes had better technology
        China invented gunpowder/canon 808/1128  (Europe 1326)
          first used for fireworks;
      Kings/scholars/business: no link of technology/wealth
      Napoleon (1805) used logistics/strategy, did not listen
        to pleas for airplanes, rockets, submarines...

  The Ideal of Progress
    Before scientific revolution, no belief in progress;
      If Muhammad, Jesus, Buddha, Confucius did not sole hunger/poverty/disease
      how could we? --> belief in messiah...
      Tower of Babel, Icarus --> progress is hubris
    After: hunger/poverty/disease are fruits of ignorance
      Lighting, God's anger --> electric current
      Franklin with lightning rod  disarmed the gods
    Poverty
      Jesus anointed with 300 denarii (one year's wages)
        "you will always have the poor, but not me..."
      Now: policies based on agronomy, economics, medicine, sociology
        Social poverty (opportunities) not solved,
          Biological (lack of food/shelter) solved;
            safety nets: insurance, social security, local/international NGOs
        Most people in danger of obesity no hunger

  The Gilgamesh project
    Problem of death:
      Pre-modern: religions: death is meaning of life; invest in afterlife
      Gilgamesh (2,000 BC) of Uruk in Sumer
        His best friend, Enkidu, dies
        After several days worm comes out of his nose
        Vows that he will never die
        Fails after long quest, learns that
        gods created man's inevitable destiny and must learn to live with
      1199 King Richard died 2 weeks after arrow in shoulder
        Now minor injury
      Battle of Waterloo 1815: heaps of sawed off arms/legs next to hospital,
        by carpenters & butchers.
        life expectancy 25-40, no 67, 80(in developed countries)
      Before 1900, ~30% children died before adulthood, 0.7%
      King Edward 1241-1290, children deaths:
        1. birth, daughter
        2. 1-3 year old daughter
        3. six months daughter
        4. 5 year old son
        5. six year old son
        6. 29 year old daughter
        7. 5 month old daughter
        8. 35 year old daughter
        9. 10 year old son
        10. 58 year old daughter
        11. 2 year old daughter
        12. daughter after birth
        13. 53 year old daughter
        14. son after birth
        15. 34 year old daughter
      #16 son became King Edward II, 62% died before adulthood
      miscarriages not included, Edward II wife had him murdered when he was 43
      Project Gilgamesh: make man immortal by 2050.
      After 1700 religions lost interest in after-life.
      Nationalism only ideology that award death,
        whoever dies in conflict will live in collective memory

  Sugar daddy of Science
    Let scientists/technologists create heaven on earth;
      but they are shaped by economic/political/religious interests
    Success of science in last 500 years is result of massive investments
      NOT because of individual persons, Darwin....
      Funding was not altruistic
        it was to benefit economic/political/religious interests
        1500s expedition for economic interest
        1940s nuclear physics to win wars
        Finding is limited; must answer
          'what is important'
      Scientists not aware of this - act of pure curiosity
        almost never dictate science agenda
        explain what maybe in future but not 'what should be'
          only religion/ideology can do that
    Science cannot set priorities or what to do with discoveries;
      use genetics to cure cancer create better cows...
    Capitalism and imperialism: biggest influences of science

15. The marriage of Science and Empire
    Measure earth-sun distance:
      measure the 1761 Venus transit at Siberia, N. America, S. Africa
      at 1769 at W. Pacific - Tahiti under captain Cook
        set astronomer, botanists, artists...
        (founded with 4% accuracy)
        Cook:
          returned 1777 with proof that scurvy is cured with citrus fruits
          recorded political and military value data:
            anthropological, astronomic, geographical, meteorological
          took claim of:
            Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand
              result in extermination of native culture and (90%) population
              most fertile land taken over by Europeans
              local catastrophe without recovery
    Tasmania:
      10K years in isolation
      entire population wiped out 100 years after Cook
        settlers took over fertile parts and hunted and killed locals
        remaining natives refused to learns new ways stopped having kids and died
        corpses of last Tasmanian used by anthropologists and curators
          Royal College of Surgeons held samples of skin and hair
            of Truganini(last native Tasmanian) until 2002
    Was Cook's ship a scientific expedition protected by military force
     or military expedition with scientists tagging along?
       half empty or half full? - it was both
       ---> science and imperialism were inseparable;
       Cook, astronomer, botanists, local could distinguish science from empire.

  Why Europe?
    Roman empire, wealth from: N. Africa, Balkans, middle East
      Poor W. Europe provided minerals and slaves
    1500-1750 Europe master of the 'outer world'; America's & oceans'
      Asian empires: Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, Ming and Qing
      1775 80% of world economy; not interested in 'outer world'
    1750-1850 wars and conquering of Asia
    1900 control most of world economy and territory
    1950 USA/ Europe production > 50%
         China 5%
    Now all humans European in dress, thought, and taste
    Chinese economy built on European model
    Why European military supremacy 1850+?
      Science
        "We have machine guns they don't"
        Logistics: Canned goods, railroads, ships, medicine more important
      Before 1850:
        scientific fruits unripe, but
        Europeans thought/behaved in a scientific/capitalist way.
      After 1850:
        Britain leaped forward(1830 1st railroad), France, Germany, US followed
        Russia, Italy, Austria close the industrial gap
        Persia, Egypt, Ottomans, China did nothing
        25,000 track miles, Asia/Africa 2,500
        1880 220,000 vs 22,000 (most in India by the British)
      China, Persia lacked values, myths, judicial, social-political for change

  The mentality of conquest
    Science grew along expansion of Spain, Portugal,Britain, France, Russia, Netherlands
    Colonialist/Scientist admitted ignorance -"I do not know what is out there"
      both hope discoveries would make them masters of the world
      sought new knowledge
        Previous empire sought power and wealth
    Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 with 165 scholars
      important discoveries in Egyptology, religion, linguistics, botany
    British 1831 sent ship to map S. America with Darwin on board
    Comedian joke:
      Apollo 11 astronauts came up to a local Indian in dessert
        He asked them to memorize a message in his language to take to the moon
        Later found message was "Do not believe a single word, these people
        have come to steal your lands"

  Empty maps
    'Explore & conquer'/scientific mindset:
       1400s & 1500s world map had empty spaces - scientific mindset
       Salviati map was mostly empty
    Columbus: Japan 4,375 miles west (actually 12,500)
      landed in Indies, convinced he knew the whole world
    Discovery of America: foundational event of scientific revolution;
      favor observation instead of tradition
      desire to conquer
      search for new knowledge
    Europeans drawn to empty spots on the map and filled them in.
      1400s & 1500s created bases, colonies - global network
      histories of isolate people --> history of the world
    Took 400 years for Romans to get to Britain
      could conceive of sailing directly and conquering Britain
      Alexander the great did not create new empire;
        he conquered the Persian empire
    Zheng He of Ming dynasty, 1405-1433:
      7 armadas - 300 ships 30,000 men
      visited India, Africa
      assisted pro-Chinese rulers; did not conquer or colonize
        Qin (north province)(221-206 B.C.E.) unified China, ruling system,  language
           Great Wall and famous Terracotta Army
        Yuan (center) Dynasty (1279-1368)
          Kublai Khan grandson of Genghis Khan; first Mongolian ruler
        Ming (bright) Dynasty (1368-1644)
        Qing (blue) Dynasty (1644-1912)- stopped exploration
          Manchus from north China - Manchuria
      proved that European did not have technological edge
        they more ambition to explore and conquer
        (China did not even conquer Japan)
   European fever:
     go to distant land: 'I claim all these territories for my king'

  Invasion from outer space
    1492 Columbus comes, in 20 years entire Caribbean population gone
    1517 Spaniard heard of Mexican empire
    4 years later Cortes put Aztec capital in ruins
      Cortes ignored last minute mission cancellation by Cuban governor
    1532 Pizarro conquers Incas
      King of Spain gave him permission
    Incas/Aztecs did not know: each other or the Spaniards
    Aztecss:
      white skin aliens,
      lots of face hair
      sun-color hair
      stank horribly - natives assigned to accompany them with incense
      giant ships
      rode huge terrifying animals
      produce lighting an thunder out of metal sticks
      long swords/impenetrable armor
      some thought they were gods
      others they were demons
      saw no urgency - 550 men against millions
    Spaniards
      1492 + 27 = 1519 + 14 = 1532
      Cortes: born 1485
        knew earth full of unknown men
        experience dealing with new men
        plunging in unknown was a challenge
        550 men, 'We come in peace, take us to you leader' - 1519
        marched from Vera Cruz to Tenochtitlan (Mexico city) ~250 miles
        brought before Montezuma
        honored guest killed bodyguards & took Montezuma hostage
        Montezuma pretended he was in charge
        for several moths learned local dialects
        sent expeditions to learn about tribes
        were expelled from Tenochtitlan
        convinced local Aztec enemies to join the fight
          got an army of tens of thousands
          together conquered Tenochtitlan - 1521
        100 years after arriving 90% of the local population gone
        honored by Charles V Spanish holy Roman emperor - 1528
        dies of dysentery 1547
      Pizarro: born 1478
        168 men
        1530 starts S. expedition
        1532 plagiarized Cortes, captured Inca leader Atahualpa
        1533 kills Atahualpa, capture capital Cuzco.
        conquered Incas with help from local allies
        assassinated 1541 - organized by Diego de Almagro II
          his mother was native Panamanian
    Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, China empires do not react
      think world revolves around Asia
      send no expeditions
      only non-European military expedition:
         1942 Japan captured Kiska & Attu - Alaskan islands, 10 US soldiers and a dog
      300 years European conquests and wars between themselves
      Algeria, Vietnam successfully fought greater powers
        What if Incas/Aztec had help from Spain rivals?

  Rare spiders and forgotten scripts
    Science and empire motivated by discoveries but
      building empire was a science project
      When Muslsims invade India, they did not bring archaeologists/anthropologists
      geologists, zoologists to study history/culture/soils/fauna
      1802 British started the Great survey of India
        alsted 60 years - measured height of mount everest 8,839.2 m,
        actual 8,844.4 ±0.2
        military resources
        location of Gold mines
        spiders, butterflies
        forgotten languages
        dig up ruins
        1922 discovered civilization that perished 1,900BC
          previous rulers n notice it
      Cuneiform script:
        1618 Spanish ambassador to Persia noticed it
        1657 script published; not deciphered
        1830 Behistun Inscription 500BC old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian
           Rawlinson deciphered old Persian (new modern Persian)
           Elamite disa[eared after Alexander the great]
        William Jones found similarities of Sanskrit (in Hindu rituals)
         and Greek, Latin,Gothic, Celtic... languages
         matar is mother in Sanskrit
         method used to study other languages
    British: 5K officials, 40-70K soldiers, 100K business people
      ruled 300M Indians
    Study of language, botany, history... gave empire ideological justification
      new knowledge always good
      Any science history says something good about first explorers
      but not much about suffering of natives
      empires were for improving not exploiting local population
      Kipling's "the white man's burden":
         bind your sons to exile
         to serve your captive's need
         ...
         your new-caught, sullen peoples,
         half devil, half child
       Counter to this:
       British conquer Bengal 1764
          economic policy --> great Bengal famine 1769-1773,
                              7-10M deaths  1/3 population
          East India Company (1600 - 1874) had 250K army = 2x British army
    Empires did lots of good and bad;
      cannot be labeled good or evil
    Science provided proof that Europeans are superior - have right and duty
      to rule
      Earliest speakers of Sanskrit were Aryans
      + Darwin's evolution = Aryan superior race - light-hair/blue-eyes/hard-working
    Now: racism is liability after empires crumbled
      Superiority is justified with cultism
        it is their blood --> it is in their culture
        supported with studies
    Culturism, unlike racism: harder for historians/anthropologists to disavow.
      If cultural difference are trivial why study them?
    Science provided imperialists with:
      practical knowledge, ideological justification, technology
    Imperialists provided science with:
      funding, information, protections, opportunity to spread scientific thinking
    Businessmen wanting to make money, capitalism, made both possible.

16. The Capitalist Creed
   Money needed for empire & science
   Most of history production per capita constant
   1950 $550/yr 2020 8,800/yr ~x20
   USA deposit multiplier x10, for $100 bank keeps 10% loans up to 90%
     Trust in imaginary future: sole backing for most money in the world.
     Money is trust in future (credit)
   Old money:
     People used credit but did not want to extend
        did not trust the future
        (believed total total wealth was limited;
         business was zero sum game)
     Zero sum game;
       one wins another looses --> money is sinful;
       Jesus: 'easier for camel to pass through eye of needle than for
               rich man to enter the kingdom of god'
       If pie is static, I must have taken it from someone-
         rich must repent for evil deeds
       Global pie stays the same --> no margin credit;
         loans: small, short term, high interest rates
       Entrepreneur's dilemma:
         no product --> no money --> no contractor --> no factory
         --> loose-loose (no growth);
             expectation of stagnation fulfilled itself

  A growing pie
    Scientific revolution:
      Admit ignorance & invest in research --> belief in progress
    Economic revolution:
      Beliefs in: progress --> geographic discoveries, inventions, organizational
                  developments.
      --> increase in total production/trade/wealth
      Via roller coaster progress over 500 years
    Adam Smith, Scottish economist:
      'The wealth of nations': When landlord, weaver,... has more profits
      than he needs, he hires assistants
      Revolutionary economic/moral/political idea:
        Selfish urge for more profit --> increase of collective wealth.
        Greed is good.
        Egoism is altruism.
        I become rich, I benefit everyone.
        win-win
      Thew that gates of heaven open for the rich.
    New ethic:
      Profits should be reinvested in production;
        bigger factory, more research, new products ---> more production
      Capitalism:
        Capital: money, goods, resources.
          invested in production
        Pharaoh who builds a pyramid is not a capitalist.
    Medieval nobility:
      Generosity & conspicuous consumption;
        tournaments, palaces, wars, cathedrals
      Colorful robes & gold decorations
    Modern elites:
      CEOs, industrialists, stock traders
        richer than nobility
        less spending on non-production
        Dreary uniforms/suits
        Private jets
        Versace $3,000 suit
    Investors:
      private citizens
      governments:
        new ports --> more exports --> more taxes
        more education --> high paying jogs....
    Capitalism:
      descriptive and prescriptive
      economic growth is supreme growth;
        free enterprise, thrift, self-reliance
        justice, freedom, happiness depends on it
    Science research:
      only for increasing production
      (nutrition does not, hence less funding)
    Capitalism depends on Science:
      Perpetual growth counter to natural laws.
      Perpetual scientific discoveries foot the the bill.
      Banks governments print money
        hoping for new discoveries (AI, bio-engineering...) before bubble bursts

  Columbus searches for investor
    Asia until lat 1700s had more capital than Europe
      no interest in credit/merchants
      interest in wars via taxes/plunder
    Europe
      kings/generals adopted capitalism
      conquest finance with credit- not taxes
      --> mercantile empires
    Columbus, 1484, proposed: Portugal, Italy, France, England, Portugal,Spain
      (last one hit the jackpot - gold, sugar, tobacco
        made royalty, bankers, merchants rich)
    100 years later more money for exploration;
      Financial momentum increase from conquest to conquest
    Expedition/financial duds:
      North-western passage, storm losses....
        ---> limited liability joint-stock companies, no cap on profits
             small investment --> millionaire
    Spanish empire:
      N. & S. America, Philippines, Africa
      ruled around Netherlands 1556 to 1714.
      1568 Dutch (protestant) revolt
        in 80 years built their own empire
        Used credit to built fleet and hire mercenaries to fight
        Amsterdam: most important port & finance center
        meanwhile Spanish king squandered the trust  of investors
    Dutch success:
      1. Always repaid loans
      2. Independent (from king) judicial protected property rights
      3. Empire built by merchants not kings
    Stock exchanges in major European cities
    Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)
      (Dutch East-India Company) (1602 - 1795)
      Silver and copper from Japan traded with Mughal India and Qing China,
      for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles
      financed military against competitors, pirates
         ruled Indonesia for 200 years:
           400% return
           conquest sold as civilizing mission
           hired European, Indonesian, Indian, Japanese mercenaries
       (Dutch government rule of Indonesia
         1816 to 1941
         Japan invasion 1941
         1945-1949 Dutch Indonesian war)
       Current warning for large corporations
     Dutch West Indies company (WIC)
       built New Amsterdam settlement
       British captured it in 1664 named New York
       Wall street paved over the settlement wall
     ~1700 Dutch lost financial center status
     British, smaller than French pick it up...
       Mississippi Bubble:
          Mississippi company, connected to Louis XV sold shares
            CEO was also finance minister
            company had swamps & alligator but claimed riches
            shares started 500 at 1717 --> 2,750 by Aug. 1719 --> 10,000 in 4 months
              --> French euphoria  --> sell panic
              CEO as finance minister bought shares but ran out of money
              share value dropped to zero
              small investors committed suicide
          --> French empire collapsed
          --> British empire took over (French and Indian War 1754–1763)
          1789 Louis XVI found 1/2 budget was for interest loan
                 convened French parliament --> start of French revolution
                                                Louis XVI executed
     British finance expansion via stock exchange;
       London Co  1607  Jamestown - indentured servitude
       Virginia Co 1606 tobacco
       Dorchester Co  1623, 14 fishermen settled in Gloucester
       Massachusetts Bay Co. 1628 after failure of Dorchester Co Puritans
                             settlers were shareholders
       British East India Company: ruled India for ~100 years
                                   had 350k army
                                   nationalized in 1858
     Napoleon: BritaiBengaln is nation of shopkeepers
               (after 23 years the shopkeepers defeated him at 1815;
                scavenged "Waterloo teeth" (from healthy young men) in demand;
                they created the largest empire ever seen)

  In the name of capital
     Indonesia/India were nationalized in 1800/1858
     Large stakeholders made government look after their interests-
       Marx: western governments became capitalist trade union
     First opium war (1840-42):
       government bidding of big money
       British East India Company (MPs ministers were stock holders)
         exported opium to China --> millions of Chinese addicts
       China banned opium, confiscate & destroyed cargo
       1840 Britain declared war in the name of "free trade"; used
          steamboats, heavy artillery, rockets, rapid fire rifles
       Chinese lost, compensated for damages, gave up control of Honk Kong
       10% of Chinese were drug addicts
     Suez canal project (1859 - 1869):
       French/British huge loans to Egypt
       Egyptian nationals default on loans
       Britain became British protectorate until WWII
     Greek rebellion
       (war like opium a commodity)
       British proposed to rebel leaders Greek Rebellion Bonds
       36-year bond  £472,000   9.17% interest 1824
                     £1,100,000 9.80%          1825
                      120% of the country’s GDP
       Bonds rose/fell according to the war
         global fiscal crisis began in December 1825,
         1826 government suspended debt payments
         Before imminent defeat British with intentional fleet 1827
           sank Ottoman flotilla in Navarino (Pylos)
           --> Greek economy mortgaged to British for decades
         1831 Kapodistrias assassinated
         1833 King Otto & 60M franc (odious) loan
         1843 loan default
         1854 British and French navies occupied Piraeus
         payments continued into the 1930s
       Capital/politics bear-hug:
         credit determined by production/inventions AND
         regime change, foreign policy...
       Battle of Navarino
         --> more risky loans because of British government backing
       Credit rating:
         economic/political/social/cultural factors
           oil producers with bad ratings
           poor countries with good ratings

  The Cult of the Free market
    Ardent capitalists:
      capital free in influence politics
      politics should not influence capital
      with reinvestment increase the common good
    Reality:
      No market WO polical influence
        Most important resource - trust in future
          is always threatened by thieves....
        Politics not markets can protect against theft
        Proof:
          Mississippi bubble, 2007 housing crisis...

  The Capitalist Hell
    Adam Smith: greedy shoe profits --> more hiring;
                egoistic greed benefits all
      but monopoly; greedy shoe profits --> less wages, more hours
        even --> limit freedom of movement...slavery
    Slavery:
      unknown in medieval Europe
      rose with capitalism
    Gold, silver, sugar, cotton, tobacco
       Sugar:
         secret food & pseudo-medicine ingredient;
         0-->18lbs/yr 1600--> 1800
         labor intensive, malaria problems
           --> slavery
               10M Africans 1500s --> 1800s  70% in sugar plantations
              for people/businessmen to enjoy sweets/profits
    Private slave COs:
      stocks traded in London/Paris/Amsterdam
      traded sugar, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton, run
      in 1700s had 6% investment yield
      profit not racism driven
      Unrestricted growth --> catastrophe
         Millions killed:
            Capitalism: indifference & greed
            Christianity/Nazism: hatred
    Capitalist catastrophes:
      1. Slave trade
      2. Great Bengal famine (British East India Co & monsoons)
         (Another Bengal famine (1943):
             1-4M deaths,  malaria biggest killer
             food diversion for WWII
             --> cloth famine, social inequality...)
         (1971 ware of independence 0.5-3M deaths)
      3. Industrial revolution - millions of workers made poor
    Belgian Congo
      Congo Free State
      1876 Belgian king Leopold II set up NGO:
        explore Central Africa and fight slave trade
          real aim growth & profit
        20-30M people, in land x70 Belgium's
        hospitals/schools --> mines/rubber-plantations with forced labor
          villages punished (hands cut off) for failing rubber quotas
      1885-1905 ~6M deaths, 20% population
      2020 Belgian king issued apology WO mention of Leopold II
   After 1945, fear of Communism reined in greed
     2014 economic pie much larger, but
     poor in Africa/Indonesia worse off than 500 years ago
     economic growth and hunger continues concurrently
   Capitalism's reply to criticism:
     1. nobody but capitalist can run the world
        communism was so much worse no one supports it
        In 8,500 BC Agricultural revolution was cruel, but
          there was no turning back - similar with capitalism
     2. patience - capitalistic paradise is around the corner
        mistakes made but we have learned
        proof: life expectancy, child mortality, calorie intake
               despite exponential population growth

17. The wheels of industry
    Capitalism (economic growth) requirements:
      reinvest profits, energy, raw materials
    Counter-intuitive:
      energy/raw-material use increase ---> availability increase
        (form science/technology investments)
    Pre-industrial:
      Problems:
        not enough or inconvenient use of forests/hydro-wind-power
        energy could not be converted from one type to another
          except human/animal conversion of food energy to physical energy
      Energy
        sun --> plants --> animals --> muscle-power
        human history:
           1. annual growth cycle
           2. daily solar cycle
        Everyone powered with solar energy stored in wheat....

  The secret in the kitchen
    Thousands of years people saw water boil without seeing the potential...
    1st breakthrough: 900AD gunpowder in China
    2nd               1500AD artillery
    3rd British coal mines
          population growth --> loss of forests --> flooded coal mines --> steam engine
    4th Improved steam engine;
          connected to looms and gins (cotton engines) --> cheap textiles
    5th Mobile steam engines (train) 1825
          13 miles from mine to port
    6th Passenger trains 1830
          Liverpool to Manchester ~ 25 miles
          20 years later: thousands of miles of rail lines
    Physicists found way to harness atomic power:
      make electricity, power subs, annihilate cities
    600 years from Chinese gunpowder to Turkish cannon pulverizing Constantinople
    40 years from E=mc2 to Hiroshima
    100 years for Internal combustion engine to revolutionize transportation
    Electricity: the genie in a lamp
      prints books, sews clothes, keep vegetables fresh, cook dinner,
      execute criminals, registers thoughts, records smiles, lights the night
      countless TV shows

  An Ocean of Energy
    Industrial revolution == energy conversion revolution
    solar energy on earth: 3.8*10^24 joules/year  ~ 4 yotta joules /year
                           1.2*10^17 watts ~ 0.1 exa Watts
                  verify:  1380 W/m2 * 3.14 * (6.4*10^9)^2 =~0.1 exa Watts
       Photosynthesis 3*10^21 J/yr  = 3,100 exa Joules/year
                                    = 10^14 W = 100 tera watts
       Global energy consumption:  2021 6*10^20 = 600 exa joules / year
                                   6*10^20 J /365/24/3600 = 1.8*10^13 W
                                   ~ 20 tera watts
                                   ~ 10^-4 solar power ~ 1 hour solar
                                   10% of photosynthesis
       1 Joule = 1 N*m  ~ .1 kg * 9.8 m/sc^2 * 1 m
                 100 grams (3.5 oz) lifted for one meter
    Aluminum, 1820, more expensive than gold
      Napoleon III used aluminum cutlery for distinguished guests
    People used olive oil for dry skin
      now use hand lotion with materials discovered last 200 years
    Haber's discovered to make ammonia from air
      without it Germany would have surrendered before 1918

  Life in the conveyor belt
    Industrial revolution = cheap energy/raw-materials -
      --> human productivity explosion;
      2nd agricultural revolution
        muscle --> machine
        fertilizers, insecticides, hormones, medicine, refrigerators, ships/airplanes
  Humanist religions --> homo sapiens divine status
    --> animals viewed as machines
    hens in 10x8.5 in space
    pigs in pens cannot turn around
    dairy cows  stand sit in their urine excrement
      food/hormones/medicine for one machine
      milked by another
  Atlantic slave trade/animal industry motivate by profit not hatred
  Science that created the meat/milk/egg industries
    demonstrated the complex sensory/emotional life of animals;
    Evolutionary psychology:
      emotional/social need of domesticated animals evolved in the wild
        essential for survival & reproduction
        playing, bonding...
        (Mammalian playing = learning social behavior)
  Harlow's' monkey experiment (1950):
    monkeys preferred cloth mother than wire-cage mother with milk bottle
    orphaned monkey had problems socializing
      anxiety and aggression problems
    similar results with other animals
  Mechanized  livestock/cultivation --> modern socio-economic order
   90% farmers --> 2% food production + more factory hands/brains
   More hands/brains --> more steel, clothing, mobile phones,...
   ---> more supply than demand

  The age of shopping
    Frugality historical norm:
      examples: Puritans, Spartans
    Consumerism:
      ensure demand for the increased supply
      treat yourself, even if you kill yourself slowly
      Packaging:
        "treats without remorse"
        "thin slim", "healthy lifestyle"
      Popular psychology:
        "just do it"
        frugality=self-oppression
      Christmas, Memorial day = shopping holidays
      short-term goods
      Old thinking:
        selfish, decadent, morally corrupt
     Consumerism flowering:
      obesity
      US spending on diets > money needed for the hungry in the world
      double win - more food/diet consumption
    Turn of tables:
      medieval rich/poor extravagant/frugal --> modern frugal/extravagant
    Capitalist/consumerist ethic:
      invest/buy
      Previous ethics:
        tough deal: compassion, restraint.. for paradise
          most Christians/Buddhists/Confucians did not dot it...
      "invest/buy" ethic:
        greed, free rein on cravings and passions
        religion that is easy to follow
        how do we know we will get paradise?
          we have seen it on TV...

18. A permanent revolution
   Total mass:
     Home sapiens:             300 million tons
     Domesticated animals:     700
     Large/small wild animals: 100 (books, TVs are full of them)
        80K giraffe, 1.5B cattle
        200K wolves, 400M dogs
        250K chimps, 8B sapiens
   Doomsday prophesies:
     Resource scarcity - misplaced
     Ecological degradation - well founded
       May endanger sapiens;
         global warming, pollution,
       --> race of human power & human induced disasters
           'change of nature' not 'destruction of nature';
             rats roaches are doing well
             future 'intelligent rats' may look back as wee look at dinosaurs

  Modern time
    agricultural rhythms --> precise industrial schedule
    Before:
      no sense of hour or year
      no uniform working day
      sun/season/growth cycle timekeeping
    Now:
      no care of sun/season
      assembly line dependence --> precise schedule
    factory time schedule
      --> school, hospital, government, store schedule
    factory closes at 5:0o - pub better be open by 5:02
    Transportation:
      1784 carriage service had departure times
        each city/town had its own local time
      1874 train companies standardized in Greenwich time
      1880 British government did same for all Britain
        time legalized for first time in history
      BBC broadcast live Big Ben tolling
        replaced with recording after German physicists could tell the weather...
      Assyrians, Sassanian(224 to 651 AD Persia), Incas had few sun dials
        now: one home more clocks than a medieval country
             $1,000/sec commercials
             50 min to unload angst on a therapist
  Industrial revolution:
   industrial time
    urbanization
    disappearance of peasants
    industrial proletariat
    empowerment of common person
    democratization
    youth culture
    disintegration of patriarchy
    collapse of family/community
      basic blocks of tribes, cities empires... blown to atoms

  The collapse of family and community
    Before industrial revolution:
      family business, farm....
      family/community was welfare, education, health, entertainment, policing systems...
        many transactions few payments
      Empires build roads palaces waged war
        using taxes and soldiers
        stayed out of family/community
          (exception Qin dynasty 200 BC converted family heads to government agents)
        Ottoman empire allowed family vendettas
          instead of imperial police force
      Ming (1368-1644) baoja system:
        10 families= 1 jia
          10 jia = bao
        bao member committed crime, bao elder punished
        bao elders collected taxes
      Kingdoms/empires
        king was the capo di tutti capi "leader of all leaders" (mafia boss)
        collected protection money
      Person WO family/community ~1750:
        good as dead
        military or brothel
    After industrial revolution:
      weakened family/community leaders
      police stopped vendettas
      hawkers replaced traditions with fashions
      "fifth column":
        (group that undermine a larger group from within, in favor of an enemy;
         1936 early Spanish civil war; Franco 4 columns to attack Madrid
         and fifth to attack within; Russians against Ukraine war are 5th column)
        become individuals
        marry who you like
        live where ever you wish
        state not family will take care of you
          pension, food, shelter...
    Romantic literature myth:
      individual against state/market
      truth:
        state/market is father/mother of individual
        market: work, insurance, pension
        state: education, safety
               treat us as individuals
                 - no payment/punishment for relatives
      cost:
        alienated, loss of family ties
    State versus market rights;
      individuals exploited
    Millions of years evolved to think communally
      last 200 years become alienated individuals
        --> awesome power of culture
    Previously:
      money passed from one father to another
    Now:
      Money passes to waitresses, fashion designers, gym managers, dietitians,
      cosmeticians, plastic surgeons  for the market's  ideal beauty
      State requires parents to send kids to school
      Abusive parents sent to jail
      Parental authority reduced
      Kids excused for disobeying
      Parents blamed for everything that goes wrong

  Imagined communities:
    people that do not know each other but imagine that they do
    like money, limited liability company, human rights...
    old:
      kingdom, empire, church
      Chinese emperor was the father
      Muslim brothers and sisters of Islam
    new:
      consumer tribe of the market
      nationalism
      Madona fans
      Manchester United fans
      vegetarians
      environmentalists
    Imagination not lie:
      common: past, interest, future
    Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan nations of haphazard borders
      drawn by French/British diplomats
      hollow bombastic speeches about Iraqi/Syrian nation

  Perpetuum mobile
     Social order:
      old:
        static; "this is how it was and will be"
      new:
        dynamic/malleable
        universal politics for social, educational, & economic reforms
     Revolutions:
       wars: French 1789, Liberal 1848, Russian 1917
             WWI, WWII, cold war
       genocides: Armenian, Jewish, Rwandan
       totalitarians: Robespierre, Lenin, Hitler
       longest peace-times
     Tectonics of history moving, but volcanoes are silent

  Peace in our time
    2000, wars/crime deaths: 310K/520K         2002: 172K/569K
       1.6% of the 56M that died
       2.25% automobile deaths (1.26M)
       1.45% suicide deaths (815K)                   873K (more than wars/crime)
    Large state --> less violence
      Early farmers WO state had more violence
    Europe 1 murder/100K,
     global aver 9 - mostly in weak states ...Somalia, Columbia
     medieval 40
     1900s state killed tens of millions of own citizens
     1964-1985 Brazil dictatorship killed thousand, but
       25% to 50% of indigenous men died over prestige, women, or property

  Imperial retirement after 1945
    British empire 1/4 globe --> few islands in 30 yrs
      peaceful except for Malaya (Malaysia) & Kenya
    French empire
      peaceful except for bloody collapse in Algeria & Vietnam
    Soviet 1989
     fastest and quietest collapse; no rebellion, no invasions...
     Soviets/Communists/Gorbachev had arms but choose not to use them

  Pax Atomica
    Since 1945 war is no longer the norm
      similar to 1871 - 1914
    Previous wars:
      1879-84 Chile Bolivia-Peru
      1932-5 Bolivia Paraguay
      1941 Peru Equator
      1970 Syria Jordan
      1990 Iraq Kuwait
    Africa
      civil wars
    Iron law of international politics:
      "For every 2 polities war is plausible within in 1 year" -law of jungle
      China, medieval Europe, Ancient Greece
      Israel/Syria USA/Iran Ethiopia/Eritrea are exceptions
    Cause of peace:
      1. cost of war gone up
         Peace prize to end all peace prizes to Oppenheimer/nuke-bomb makers
           avoid collective suicide
      2. Profits declined
           materials; looting gold, occupy fields
           not as profitable as human capital & know-how
             California first had gold, but now entertainment/software
                engineers, script writers, special effects wizards
      3. Lucrative peace
         foreign trade & investments
      4. Peace loving elites (politicians/businessmen)
         Pacifists in power - old elites viewed war as good
      5. Positive feedback of 1-4
         nuke fear --> pacifism --> trade increases --> war obstacle
         --> global empire (borders is the globe itself)
    Too early to tell;
      history to decide where we will end up

19. And they lived happily after
    Last 500 years:
      one ecological/historical sphere
      exponential wealth
      super human powers
      unlimited energy
      politics/daily-life/psychology transformations
      BUT are we happier?
          is the world better place to live?
    Happiness
      Nationalists: self-determination
      Communists: proletariat dictatorship
      Capitalists: free market
    Historians typically avoid happiness topic;
      Agriculture revolution:
        more collective power but,
        work harder, more disease/exploitation
      European empires:
        more science/technology but,
        oppression/genocide of natives
      Likely misuse of power --> more clout != more happiness
    Romantic spin:
      More power --> mechanistic world; not for hunter instincts
      Every invention pulls out of Eden further
    Medicine, reduction of violence, elimination of famines, large war
      oversimplification?
      1. small number of years
          1850-1851 China's Great Leap forward
            10 to 50M people starved to death
          Truganini is no less important than Homer Simpson
      2. golden age of last half century --> seeds of future catastrophe
           reckless consumption --> ecological disaster
      3. Industrial/medical exploitation of animals
            consider only happiness of humans?

  Counting happiness
    Happiness = f(health,diet,wealth; objective conditions)
              = f(social, ethical, spiritual); studied for millennia
              = f(subjective expectations)
    Questions to measure happiness:
      how one feels
    Money bring happiness only if you are poor
      if not temporary
    Illness decreases happiness in short term
      Diabetes get depressed for a short while
    Money/illness over time have little impact
    Family/community far more important
      good/bad marriage --> happiness/misery
    Current immense material improvements offset by collapse of family/community
    Happiness --> objective condition versus subjective expectations
      winning lottery or debilitating car accident both have little long impact
      poets philosophers have known this
      now backed with data
    Happiness depends on expectations:
      media/advertising are depleting happiness
    Third world discontent
      more about exposure to first world standards than
      poverty, disease, corruption...
      Egyptian uprising was about comparison to the west
    Magic cures/immortality
      --> discontent for the that will not afford them

  Chemical happiness
    Biology: happiness depends on biochemistry shaped by evolution
             not by external parameters (salary, house, true love..)
             serotonin - neurotransmitter/hormone
                         happy, focused, calm
                         memory, sleep; depression, anxiety, blood clotting
                         90%/10% produced in intestines/brain
                         tryptophan-containing foods - eggs, seeds, pineapple
                         sunlight, exercise
             dopamine - neurotransmitter/hormone
                        rewards/motivation
                        happy, alert, focused
                        memory, sleep; depression, anxiety
                        Parkinson’s loss of movement
                        sugar addiction
                        produced by adrenal(on kidney) gland, hypothalamus
             oxytocin - love/hug hormone
                         male/female hormone
                         labor/delivery/lactation
                         produced by hypothalamus release by pituitary gland
                         induce /speed labor, semen ejection
                         trust, romantic attachment, bonding
                         linked to prostate cancer, low levels--> autism
             cortisol - steroid hormone
                        increases blood sugar
                        aids metabolism
                        adrenal gland
                        stress prone:
                          abused children, airplane crash survivor, military, police
    Happiness = pleasant reactions in body
                reaction to chemicals from winning lottery...
    Evolution has made happiness constant
      no natural selection for more happiness
    Human biochemistry--> air condition; return to same set point
      brain setting 7/10 - happy no matter what
      brain setting 5/10 - gloomy no matter what...
    Married people happier than single
      correlation not causation; could be happier people get married
      People born with cheerful biochemistry (serotonin...) tend to get married
    Happiness depends on biochemistry much less on history
      French revolutionaries executed king, gave land to peasants,
        declared rights of man, abolished noble privileges, fought all of Europe
        but did not change French happiness.
        Biologist would have never done this, other people get tricked in doing it.
      Stop wasting time in politics, social reforms, ideologies...
        Only thing that works: prozac (fluoxetine) depression, obsessive compulsive
    "Happiness Begins Within":
       comes only from serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin
       Brave new world: 'soma' make people happy, no wars, one world government..

  The meaning of life
    Nietzche: 'if you have a why to live, you can bear an how'
      parents have more hard moments raising kids but are happy doing it
      --> cognitive and ethical dimension to happiness
    Medieval peasants may have happier than us
      they believed in the afterlife delusion
      Now-scientists, soldiers, businessmen have delusions:
        increase knowledge, defend homeland, create jobs
    Happiness is synchronizing personal delusion with the collective delusions
      --> self-delusion

  Know thyself
    Increase happiness:
      1. re-engineer biochemistry
      2. self-delude with meaning
      3. know thyself (Apollo temple in Delphi)
           Liberal
             politics: voter knows best
             economics: customer ...
             art: beauty is relative
           'what I feel is good is good' Rousseau
           (Paradox: people know their happiness
                    but need help to free them from unhappiness)
           Most religions very different form this;
           Christians: having sex increases sin not happiness
             most people are like addicts - they are happy when they shoot up
           Selfish gene theory: people choose reproduction
                                instead what is good for them (DNA like Satan
                                uses pleasure to place them in its power)
    Buddhism:
      consistent with science - happiness is within not from outside
      most people want more pleasure and less pain
      feelings are fleeting vibrations like ocean waves
        joy can be gone in 5 minutes
        one keeps chasing it
        if one catches it, he have to start over
        Why chase something that disappears?
        Root of suffering:
          Never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings,
            causes: tension, restlessness & dissatisfaction
          NOT pain, sadness, or meaningless
        Liberation from suffering:
          know that feelings are not permanent & stop craving for them
          Meditation: observe mind/body witness coming/going of feelings
                      realize how pointless the pursuit is and stop it
                      Stop pursuit:
                        mind relaxed, clear, satisfied
                        feelings accepted for what they are
    West New Age movement (1970s):
      turn Buddhism on its head:
      "Happiness is what you feel inside; stop chasing wealth status
       and connect with inner feelings" or
       'Happiness Begins Within' - exactly what biologists say
                                   but opposite of Buddha
        Buddhism is stopping pursuit of achievements AND inner feelings
    Most religions key to happiness:
      know thyself
      cannot identify with feelings/thoughts/likes/dislikes
    History of happiness:
      Not about fulfilled expectations or feeling pleasure
      About knowing oneself
      Field just starting; needs questions, evidence...
    History is about: social structures
                      empires
                      discovery/spread of technologies
                      nothing about individual happiness/suffering (lacuna)

20. The End of Home Sapiens
   Natural selection:
     for 4 billion years
     no need for intelligent design to explain giraffes...
     gave Sapiens advantage over other life forms
     sets Sapiens boundaries
       but Sapiens is beginning to break them
   Intelligent design:
     10K years ago - breeding of chickens - accelerate natural selection
       symbiosis of sapiens/chicken
   Engineering of life forms
     bio-artist Kac created fluorescent green rabbit Alba; jelly fish genes
     most import since life began
   natural selection --> intelligent design:
     1. bio-engineering
     2. cyborg (mixture of 1 &2)
     3. engineering of in-organic life

  Of mice and men
    bio-engineering:
      castration of bulls to create oxen for 10K years
      castrated of males for sopranos and for the sultan's harem
      change sex via surgery & hormones
      artificial ear in mouses back
    push-back: monotheists, atheist, animal-rights, human-rights
      to many possibilities and we are not wise...
    Organism with weakest political lobbies:
      plants, fungi, bacteria, insects;
        E. Coli makes bio-fuel
        Fungi maker insulin
        Frost resistant potatoes with gene from Artic fish
    Mammals:
      cows with milk containing lysostaphin (antibacterial enzyme)
        to prevent mastitis
      pigs with omega 3 fat using a worm gene
    Others:
      worms with 6x life expectancy
      smart mice
      monogamous voles


  The return of the Neanderthals
    2003 pyrenean ibex cloned - died minutes after birth
    Russian/Korean/Japanese reconstruct mammoth DNA and implant egg into elephant
    Church in Harvard university:
      $30M funding & volunteer women to produce Neanderthal child (after 30K years)
    Better Sapiens:
      Sapiens/mouse: 2.9B/2.5B nucleobases (14% difference)
      genius mouse --> genius sapiens...
      ethics/politics only obstacles
      tinkering will not kill us but we will not be sapiens

  Bionic life
    Cyborgs: eyeglasses, pacemakers, orthotics (feet bottoms), computers, phones
    Cyborg implants:
       US military: cyborg flies(to spy), sharks (to detect mines)
       bionic ear - covered by Medicare
       retina implants - experimental, 20/460 acuity
       Bionic arms with sensation of touch
    Rhesus monkey:
      controlled additional bionic arms/legs
    Locked-in syndrome:
      paralysis from stroke brain damage
      possible cure: ability to talk to move
    Two-way brain computer interface:
      machine learning -  medical alarm, mental state, emotional state,and thalamocortical dysrhythmia
      link brain to internet or to other brains?
      collective memory?  follow collective dream....

  Another life
    computer programs that can undergo evolution
      play chess, drive car, diagnose disease, invest money
      we may work for these programs;
        hire people, who to give mortgage, who to send to jail...
    Human brain project 2005
      brain in a computer
      2019 hard to find major contribution

  The singularity
    Mapping first human genome: 15 years $3B
      now: few weeks for few hundred dollars
        --> personalized medicine
      ethics: privacy, insurance companies, patents of human genome
      Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948:
        need to prevent and heal sickness
        include enhancing human abilities?
    Superiority of upper class up top now was a delusion
      now it may become reality
    Future technology change Sapiens - emotions, desires..
      not just vehicles and weapons
    Singularity:
      physics: before big bang time did not exist
      evolution: me, you, men, women concepts become irrelevant

  The Frankenstein prophesy
    1918 Nary Shelley's Frankenstein:
      science tries to create super human but creates monster;
      myth signifies last days are approaching;
        unless a nuclear of ecological disaster
        sapiens will be replaced by a different being
        (not about interplanetary travel)
        We like to think that Dr. Frankenstein can only create monsters
      Hype:
        Nuclear age in 1940 ---> everything nuclear by 2000
        Apollo 1969 --> colonies in Mars
      Likely not hype; future:
        technological transformation
        50 or hundreds of  years for immortality?
      Human enhancement:
        natural, artificial, or technological alteration of the human body
        --> different level of consciousness
           --> different religious/economic/self-identification concepts
        would starting point be Islam, feminism...
        all about Gilgamesh project;
          doing all to cure disease and improve human life
          Dr. Frankenstein is piggy-backing on Gilgamesh;
          impossible to stop Gilgamesh --> impossible to stop Frankenstein
    Can only influence the direction:
      'what do we want to become?' --> real question: 'what do we want to want?'

Afterword: The animal that became God:
  70K years ago Sapiens was insignificant animal
  Now master of entire planet and terrorist of ecosystem
    poised for eternal youth an divine abilities of creation/destruction
  Historically, increase of power:
     no improvement of individual sapiens
     misery and destruction of other animals
  Last decades:
    reduction of war, famine, disease (too soon to tell)
    deterioration of other animals/species
  Unsure of our goals, disconnected
    Advanced from canoes but do not know where we are going
    Have power but do not know what to do with it
    More irresponsible than ever
    We are self made gods with laws of physics for company
      Wrecking havoc to animals/ecosystems for comfort & amusement WO satisfaction
  Anything more dangerous than dissatisfied/irresponsible gods
    that do not know what they want?
