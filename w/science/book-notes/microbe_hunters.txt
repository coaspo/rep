Paul de Kruif, American microbiologist ðŸ—“ 1926
https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/microbiology/microbiology.html

Now: comfortable science professor at tidy little salary in cozy college
Then: Servetus burned to death for studying anatomy

1. Leeuwenhoek, Dutch tradesman, first microbe hunter, fighter of death
  born 1632 made perfect 1/8 inch lens
  sent hundreds of letters to Royal Society of England
  found little animals in rain water... silent assassins
    like Alexander finding elephants in India..
    proved that little animals come from soil
  Disbelieve in miracles and believe in miraculous facts
  at 50 well preserved teeth - cleaned with quill & rinsed with salt water
    put white plaque into rain water and found bacteria
    found that hot coffee kills them
  his secrecy for building microscope --> took 150 years to rediscover his results
  Leibnitz did not convince him to teach others
  from an older man that never cleaned mouth found new "little animals"
  capillary blood vessels, human sperm
  queen of England, Peter the great of Russia visited him at Delft
  was famous after Robert Boyle & Issac Newton
  honest, accurate, showman, secretive

2. Spallanzani - microbes must have parents
  born 1729 in northern Italy
  studied in university, became priest to support himself
  questioned everything except existence of God
  scientists believed that life (little animals) was spontaneous - without parents
    "beetles, wasps were generated in cow dung" similar for mice
  read how Redi proved maggots have mother using open/veiled covered jars of meat
    little animals must be same;
    Redi born 1697 father of experimental biology
  Needham boiled gravy in flasks, corked them and found little animals
  Spallanzani sealed gravy in sealed glass flasks boiled and boiled them
    for minutes, hours... repeated same with cork seals
    no little animals in flasks sealed with glass boiled for hours
  disproved spontaneous creation of bacteria - life comes from life
    but Needham made a Royal fellow, with Buffon ignored facts:
      Vegetative force invents life, like the force that got Eve from Adams ribs
      Needham: fierce heat destroyed the Vegetative force
      Spallanzani used fierce heat with corks and still found little animals
        repeated with baking  instead of boiling
      Needham: heat destroyed elastisity of air
        Spallanzani closed had flask with pinhole then closed it; boiling did
        damage air
  friend of Voltaire - forerunner of French revolution
  experimented with animals, ingested saw dust with meat
  accused of stealing specimens from Pravda Austria
    recommended independent investigation - cleared although guilty
  isolated single bacteria and saw it multiply

3. Pasteur - microbes are a menace
  9 years old witnessed rabies
  lectured that work/will/success = human existence
  26 discovers 4 types of tartaric acid
  tried magnets on living things, swung plants..
  1837
    Cagniard de la Tour discovers yeast in beer vats - turns barley to yeast
    Schwann meat becomes putrid only when microbes get into it
  beet-sugar distiller had problem
    Pasteur found rod shaped bacteria produce lactic acid - yeast produced alcohol
  his wife loved him to the point of understanding his work
    wrote papers which he dictated
  disproved theory that albumen (egg white) creates alcohol
  by accident discovered yeast uses ammonia salt C4H12N2O6 Ammonium tartrate
    used retort to get the alcohol
  made lots of enemies because of "am I not clever to have found this and aren't
    all you fools not to believe it at once"
  claimed to discover anaerobic bacteria;  Leeuwenhoek/Spallanzani had done it
  Opened sealed sterile flasks filled with yeast broth in train station, alps,
    still air and proved that microbes come from dust
    This was disproved by boiling boiled hay soup;
      boiling does not kill bacteria
  Examined wine in microscope to find type of spoilage (different bacteria)
    found that heating wine after fermentation below boiling kills bad bacteria
    --> pasteurization
  scum in vinegar kegs was acetobacter, created vinegar 10,000 their weight
    thought that other bacteria can enter man and kill him....
    became John the baptist of Germ Theory
  silk worm parasite problem:
    mistakenly thought disease was in moths belly, grinding moth disproved it
  had, brain hemorrhage paralyzed, read Self Help and continued to work
  "man can destroy parasitic disease; 'spontaneous generation' (biogenesis) is wrong"
  son fought in Franco-Prussian war 1870
    revenge for Prussia: make French beer better than German
    --> beer pasteurization
    not a good taster of beer - like tobacco he hated it
  proved that yeast is on, not in, the grapes; bacteria comes from outside
  Lister (sterilized surgery tools) thanked him
  Build hot house covered soil with glass to prove that yeast sticks to grapes
    after they ripen - did this after attacking dead Claude Bernard (homeostasis, double blind..)

4. Robert Koch - the death fighter
  intern in insane asylum in Hamburg
  at urge of girlfriend practiced medicine instead of going tiger hunting
  did not hear of Pasteur or Lister
  wife brought him a microscope on 28th birthday
    (later divorced, married actress)
  could not cure diphtheria (10% fatality via toxin) - did not know cause
    cure was to hitch 4 widows to their plow
  found stick/rod bacteria (bacilli) in sheep that died of anthrax
    used blood soaked wood sliver to infect mice with anthrax
    next morning dead mouse had bacilli in the blood
    invented hanging-drop method to ensure only anthrax infected ox eye liquid
    grew only anthrax for 8 generations and reinfected mice
    identified cause of disease but did not publish
    infected guinea pigs, rabbits and sheep with virus in hanging drops
  how anthrax is transmitted?
    farmers claimed that their fields were cursed
    bacteria on slide died in 2 days but lived thru winter
    at mouse temperature for 24 hours, oval beads formed inside the rods (bacteria)
      dried the rods with beads, kept for month, added it to ox eye liquid --> rods
      the beads were spores - spore form only if dead animal is kept warm
      burn dead animals or bury them deep where ground is cold and spores cannot form
  demonstration
    packed mice, spores, microscope and visited his university professor
    professor invited others
      --> great discovery 1876 - 7 years after Pasteur's prophesy
        Breslau Prussia, now Wroclaw Poland
  Koch invented  bacteria photography
  1880 called to Berlin
    by accident noted different colored spots on boiled potato
       --> different bacteria colonies
    grew single bacteria species in gelatin and beef broth
      superior did not believe it; set out to haunt tuberculosis
  tuberculosis - found blue stain to identify bacteria
    in brain, bones....
    took bodies of dead people and infected cats, chickens, rabbits, dogs, pigeons
    grew bacteria in blood-serum jelly
      serum from slaughtered animals, pasteurized with heat
      sterilized equipment with mercury chloride (highly poisonous)
      tested grown bacteria even in frogs, eels, goldfish, tortoise
    infected animals with mist
    presented findings - nobody said anything
      news rocked the world, everyone wanted to meet Koch
      "This discovery of mine is not such a great advance"
      one of this students used streptococcus to cure cancer, killing people
      another rubbed staphylococcus on this arm to prove that it causes boils
  Pasteur/Koch teams went to Alexandria to identify the Asiatic cholera
    French researcher died of cholera (humans are the only host)
    outbreak died down --> Koch went to India - founded bug in polluted waters
  Opponent drank a test tube of cholera & nothing happened
    to prove that disease is caused by disposition not germs
    others infected accidentally died
  Koch was logical: reported success and failures

5. Pasteur and the mad dog
   in 1/19 births, mother died in French hospitals - one called House of Crime
     told doctors that they were passing germs from one mother to another
   young doctor assistants:
     Roux, Chamberland, Thuillier
   chicken cholera:
     just for fun, injected chickens with weeks-old culture - got sick but recovered
     by accident, due to supply shortage - shot the same chickens again
     and they were not effected
       --> discovered vaccine - old (weak) germs - prevent death...
           used germs against themselves
     "Jenner could not do it with smallpox, I showed the germ that kills
      is the same that protects"
      an old doctor was sarcastic, Pasteur attacked this projects,
      doctor tried to hit him, then challenged him to a duel, Pasteur backed off
      published and never retracted that the cholera vaccine protects against anthrax
    made anthrax vaccine that killed mice but not guinea-pigs
      horse doctor challenged him to demonstrate it
      he did it with 46 sheep  - like Jesus turning water into wine
      one of his enemies repented - asked to do the experiment on himself
      news: Pasteur the new messiah, every wanted anthrax vaccine
      turned lab into factory
        in one year hundreds of thousands of sheet were vaccinated
          some sheep died from vaccination other were not protected
          people snickered,
          Koch: vaccine killed sheep
                contaminated with other microbes
                if Pasteur was for truth, why he did not report bad results
                "good for advertising but not for science"
          --> French response: Pasteur elected to Academie Francaise
    rabies (hydrophobia)
      Roux injected virus into brain of dogs
      vaccine: 14 doses from 14 day dried infected brain
      wanted to vaccinate all dogs....
        then vaccinate just infected dog
      used in an infected boy 1885 and
        19 Russians bitten by a mad wolf 19 days prior - all but 3 survived
        Tsar sent him diamond cross and 100K francs to built Institute Pasteur
    Last speech:
      Do not b tainted by deprecating and barren skepticism
      Ask what you have done for your instruction
      and contributed to progress and good of humanity

6. Roux and Behring massacre the guinea-pigs
   diphtheria antitoxin
   Loefffler guided by Koch:
     bacteria only in child's throat and in injection in point in animals
     claimed that toxin causes death - Roux read this......
   Roux: grew  bacteria for 4 days and filtered bacteria broth and injected 35 grams into guinea-pig
     (small doses had no effect) to see effect
     with 42 day growth, tiny amount of filtered broth was lethal
     1 oz pure toxin could kill 600K guinea-pigs
   Behring under Koch:
     tried chemicals to cure diphtheria
     chemical cure killed even faster
     iodine tri-chloride sometimes worked but burned holes into their hides
       found blood of cured animals had antitoxin and prevented death
       created antitoxin from sheep serum
     1891 antitoxin cure
   Roux
     with serum 50% fatality reduced to 26%
     in England 30% reduced to 29% without serum
   Currently:
     grow diphtheria in laboratory
     harvest toxin
     inject horses
     horse immune response creates antitoxin
     collect horse blood and remove serum which has antitoxin
     purify antitoxin

7. Metchnikoff- the nice phagocytes
  fed carmine (crimson dye from cochineal bugs) to starfish larvae (transparent)
    wondering cells in larvae ate the carmine
    (Peruvian carmine is common red dye in food; carminic acid 1/4 of bug weight
      14K bugs/kg of dye; 650 tons/year; cochineal feed on cactus
      1570's very profitable trade)
    ---> they eat microbes too --> white cells eat bacteria too
    with this guess he wrote that he became pathologist
    had explanation of disease immunity --> phagocytes
  published and gave speeches without having seen a phagocyte
    Koch snubbed him - Germans did not believe his theory;
    Behing had proved that the serum of blood fights disease
  proof:
    use water fleas and find something that infects them
    lucky to see yeast be digested by a phagocyte
    when phagocytes were to slow, yeast multiplied killing the flea
    published results & made professor in Odessa
    considered himself a theoretician; send assistant to France to learn to make vaccines
  lab was chaotic, people demanded vaccines;
    Metchnikoff spread chicken cholera to meadow mice
    press reported that it could turn to human cholera
    ordered to give anthrax vaccine and thousand of sheep died
  went to Paris, Pasteur liked the theory and gave him his own laboratory
    (Pasteur kept the show going..)
    20 year dispute with Germans about blood/phagocytes
    could not see that it is both and more....
    not being like Koch, he did not help...
    claimed to do better experiments if pretty girls were close by
    lab was like a country fair
    always did experiments to defend phagocyte theory
    lab assistant swallowed virulent cholera bacilli to prove that
      blood has nothing to do with immunity (no cholera antigen!)
    but phagocytes sometimes eat bacteria others do not... immunity varies
  gave up phagocyte work for gerontology & thanatology
    interviewed 100+ years old for instinct to die
    investigate theory that hardening of arteries is cause of aging
      with Roux inoculated monkeys with syphilis
         scratched ear with syphilis virus, then cut it off
         invented calomel ointment (Hg2Cl2) - Persian used it in 850
           treat syphilis, bronchitis, cholera, ingrown toenails, teething, gout,
           tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer
         infected volunteer with syphilis to prove calomel effectiveness
       artery hardening caused by auto-intoxication - putrefying bacilli in large intestine
         heard story of longevity Bulgaria
         bacteria that makes sour milk chases wild bacteria out
         drank sour milk for years
         English journal: larget scientific break through sine Darwin
       did not smoke, no alcohol, drank sour milk but died at 71

8. Theobald Smith
   after medical school, worked at Animal industry in Washington
   read Koch in German
   Texas fever problem:
    northern cattle died when grazed with cattle in Texas
    ranchers had tick theory
      experiments: removed all ticks from 3 southern cows
                   feed cows with grass that has ticks
      found baby ticks carry pathogen;
        calves get sick and become immune, mother cows die
      cure: dip cows to kill ticks
            keep northern cow where there are no ticks

9. Bruce - trail of the tsetse
  out of medical school joined army to be able to marry
  in Malta made agar & beef broth to find cause of Malta fever
  in Africa:
    Nagana - livestock fever
      found Trypanosoma in infected horses
        not contagious, not on dry land
      explanation:
        Europeans: the tsetse fly
        Locals: buffalo discharge contaminates grasses
      experiment:
        muzzle horses so they could not eat/drink - got sick
        is it in air? (no):  took tsetse flies to horses - they got sick
    prescription: get rid of tsetse flies
  African sleeping sickness:
    central Africa
    fever --> laziness --> open mouth while eating --> sleep --> comma --> death
    infected people had Trypanosomas in their spinal cord
      Bruce got spinal fluid from people with broken bones... and no sleeping sickness
        --> Trypanosoma causes sleeping sickness
      problem: where the reservoir?, how does it transmit?
      sickness was along narrow strip of water;
        everyone said no tsetse in Uganda - only Kivu blood suckers
      Bruce found the Kivu is the name of tsetse in Uganda
        had tsetse files feed on dying patients
          had flies infect monkeys --> monkeys died
        told Uganda prime minister to collect tsetse flies
        got envelopes full of flies - marked map if there was sleeping sickness
        prime minister evacuated 16 miles within lake shoreline
          people stopped dying
        Bruce promoted colonel, dubbed knight
        Africa safe for natives and open to benevolent whites
        after 2 years in another part of lake, sleeping sickness erupted
          a microbe hunter died after going to investigate
          Bruce found Trypanosomas in cattle and antelope
            sleeping sickness wiped out from lake Victoria
        German microbe injected himself with animal blood with Trypanosomas
          to prove nagana does not kill men
          he did not die; Bruce "regretful it did not work"

10. Ross vs Grassi - malaria
  Ronald Ross, son of a artist-general, born in India
    tried writing music, novels, poetry, mathematics
    ship doctor on New York liner, married
    back in India, with microscope failed to find germ of malaria
     "failure drove to lofty peak of solitude ... no fears, friends, loves, hates"
    met doctor Monson who discovered that mosquitoes can suck worms from Chinese blood
      showed Toss the malaria bacterium - red cells burst --> person has chills
      told him the problem: "how does it transmit"
        and his theory: "mosquitoes carry malaria"
    did not find mosquito info in library- overlooked the natural museum
    went to India to do Monson's experiments
      had mosquitoes bite infected low cast Indians
      could not find bacteria in mosquitoes
    made stories of fight of phagocyte and malaria bacteria
    fed people soup of mosquitoes with malaria
    after failures, used brown mosquitoes
      found growing black dots on mosquito stomachs & wrote poem
    1898 proved mosquito bite  transmits malaria with  birds
      published, bragged, wrote to Laveran (discover of the bacteria)
      but human transmission? (Koch failed in Italy)
        tried to proved it, in glory of England, but failed
     got Nobel prize
   Giovanni Grassi, doctor interested in zoology
     wrote about white ants & their bacteria
     eel expert, professor at 29
     mosquitoes without malaria, malaria always with mosquitoes
       --> find type of mosquito
     mosquito expert, found each type and declared it innocent..
       zeroed in Anopheles claviger
     had mosquitoes bite him -no dice
     found elder volunteer in Rome to do same
        Anopheles (zanzarone) infected him and showed symptoms after 10 days
     grew Anopheles in sugar water, melon..
       repeated human experiments, newspapers were sarcastic...
     with his friends disproved Koch that baby mosquitoes
       get malaria from their mother - like the Texas fever
     hundreds of experiments - prove human/bird malaria do not mingle
     preached to avoid Anopheles
     human experiment:
       in infected region where people fled in the summer
         had people use screens and not go outside at dusk
         gave money prizes to enforce rules
         lived there himself
     did not get Nobel prize
     made senator for life
   Ross/Grassi fight:
    Grassi is a thief, charlatan
    "facts of science are greater than little men who find those facts"

11. Walter Reed - in the interest of science and humanity
  yellow fever human guinea pigs in Cuba got 200 dollars each
    common theory: in the air, Dr. Finlay in Cuba it is the mosquitoes
    killed more American soldiers than Spaniard bullets
  Reed did not find bacteria
    noticed nurses soiled by sick were never infected
    outbreak made him believe air transmission
    called Dr. Finlay who gave him mosquito eggs
      cannot use animals to experiment - not effected
      use humans? up to 80% fatality
        Reed asked commission to be bitten first; Lazear, Carroll volunteered
          left instructions how to do it and left for Washington;
            not approved by military
        Lazear with 7 volunteers got bit but remained healthy
        Carroll got bit with the worst mosquito, got sick, and nearly died
          4 men bit 2 died
        Lazear not convinced, accidentally got bit, infected
          died Sep. 25 1900
        Reed comes back to Cuba, got military funding to experiment with
          himself and 7 paid volunteers - set up 7 tents in camp Lazear
             volunteers isolated weeks before injection
          let all soldiers know about another war...
          2 soldiers volunteered and wanted no money
          5 paid Spanish immigrants
          8 men got it 1 died
            paralysis returned to some later...
    mosquitoes transmit, but is it in clothes?
      experiment: build small house with soiled hospital pillows, sheets ..
         guinea pigs: doctor and 2 soldiers, beat sheets.. around the house
           stayed 20 days - no infections
           repeat this 2 more times with more volunteers ,- no infections
             2 infected with yellow fever (survived) to prove that they were not immune
         a volunteer in a clean house with infected mosquitoes got sick
           in a room separated by fine screen did not get sick
    mosquitoes eliminated --> Havana free of yellow fever
    what causes yellow fever:
      Carroll strained any bacteria from brood, injected into 3 volunteers 2 got sick
         (virus not bacteria causes it)
         Reed asked him to stop it
    Reed died age 51 - rapture appendix
      congress gave pensions to his wife ant to Lazear & Carroll
    Bruce's "not possible to experiment with humans" was not right

12. Paul Ehrlich - the magic bullet
  smoked cigars drank beer
  "we must learn to shoot microbes with magic bullets"
  10 years younger than Koch, had seen tubercle germ in liver before Koch
    thought little rods were crystals
  found way to stain germ, caught tb and went to Egypt
  stained live animal - injected rabbit with methylene blue
    stained ending of nerves blue - did not cure pain
    instead of staining kill bacteria?
    "must be mathematical laws that govern poisons, vaccines..."
  Trypanosoma killed 100% of mice - find cure (Arsenic only helps a little)
    trial and sweating to find cure
    (by Sahachiro Hata and Ehrlich respectively)
    added sulfo-groups to red dye ("Trypan red")
      mouse pupils turned pinks but mice did not die
    publication: atoxyl (not poison) almost cured mice, but
      always killed them - Ehrlich veracious reader
    problem: how change and improve atoxyl
      preparation 606: "dioxy-diamino-arsenobenzol-dyhydro-chloride"
        (or Arsphenamine,  Salvarsan)
        killed Trypanosoma but not the mouse
        cured rabbit infected with spirochete (syphilis)
          --> found magic bullet
        biblical proportions....
        but few people died after injection
        (replaced by penicillin in 1940)
    admirer: "606 great work of the mind and wonderful scientific achievement"
    Ehrlich: "after 7 years of misfortune, had one moment of luck"
