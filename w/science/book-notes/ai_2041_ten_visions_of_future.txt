AI 2041 the ten visions of our future   Kai-fu Lee computer scientist  ðŸ—“ 2021
Chen Qifan science fiction writer


1. Deep learning
     sub-field of machine learning
     2016 AlphaGo (google) beat human Go champion
     neural networks - inspired by neurons in brain
       deep --> thousand of layers between input and output
       training: massive input data with required output
     omni-use technology:
       any domain of recognition, prediction, classification, decision-making, synthesis
     vision recognition
       25%/2% error rate before/after AI (2010/2017)

   Amazing capabilities & limitations
     1st paper 1967
     matured in 2010s from cheap technology & large training data
     massive training data --> better than human performance
     discover correlations in obscure, subtle, or complex data
     customize users
       maximize spending/attention
       Facebook maximizes time spent on Facebook
       Amazon maximizes your spending
     no: sense of experience, abstract concepts, common sense
     requirements:
       1. massive data --> internet companies first deep-learning users
       2. narrow domain
       3. concrete objective function to optimize
     Users:
       1. internet companies
       2. finance; banks & insurance COs; lemonade/waterdrop-inc in US/China
            lower default/fraud/cost(no humans), instant (via app)(no humans)
     Google inputs: search, google play, maps, gmail & youtube
     Deep-learning:
      deep neural networks,
      deep belief networks,
      deep reinforcement learning,
      recurrent neural networks,
      convolutional neural networks
      transformers
        Human or better-than humans applications:
          computer vision,
          speech recognition,
          natural language processing,
          machine translation,
          bioinformatics,
          drug design (Pfizer: â€œSupercomputing and advanced analytics"")
          medical image analysis,
          climate science,
          material inspection
          board game programs

   Deep learning downsides
     tech is double-edge;
       electricity: convenient/lethal (rare)
       internet: convenient/time-stealing; shortens attention span (norm)
     downsides:
       AI knows you better than you know yourself
         recommends products, mates...
       watch one short youtube video --> spend 3 hours
       click on provocative facebook link --> see more extreme content, spend more time
     2020 documentary: The social dilemma:
        Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse - Sophocles
        A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic - Arthur Clark

        If you are not paying for product you are the product
        Product: gradual, slight, imperceptible change in behavior and perception;
          how you think who you are

        New market: Human future trading
        Data --> predict actions; virtual avatar
          1. engagement - usage (time)
          2. growth - invite friends (growth)
          3. advertisement - money
               dial as needed
        The age or Surveillance Capitalism,  Shoshama Zuboff
        Persuasive technology - modify positive intermittent reinforcement
        slot machine like
        growth hacking - more engagement
          ab testing of small changes - everyone is a lab rat
        massive contagion experiments
          how to get people to vote - users are clueless
        Tool technology (waiting) -->  addiction/manipulation (demanding)
        Smart scientists do not know how there mind is vulnerable
        kitchen safe
        social media is drug - biological imperative to connect - propagate species
        self-harm/suicide hospital admission 1008(social media in phone)-2015:
          +62%/+70% 15-19 girls
          +189%/+151% 10-14
        algorithms - opinions embedded in code
        how to wake from matrix when you do not know you are in matrix
        utopia & dystopia at same time
        Tristan Harris:
           your click caused supercomputer to be aimed at your brain
           billions of dollars of computing power that has learned
             to trick 2 billion+ human animals to click again
   Core issue: simplicity of the objective function; maximize money
     Solution 1: more AI - make function more complex;
       add fairness,  time well spent, happiness...
   ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
     investors to identify risks & growth opportunities
     Solution 2: third party watchdogs or
                 AI owner 100% interest aligned with user
   AI able to infer sexual orientation form facial micro-expressions
     Fairness/bias problem; solution:
      1. AI CO disclosure - where/why AI is used
      2. AI engineers adopt Hippocratic oath to protect users
      3. test AI and provide warnings
      4. AI audits for privacy/fairness
   Explain how AI makes decisions - on-going work
   History:
     early errors of new tech will be fixed


Computer vision
  1. Image capture/processing - @D array of numbers
  2. Object segmentation - dive image into sections/objects
  3. Object recognition - recognize cars, dogs...
  4. object tracking - follow moving objects
  5. gesture/movement recognition - dance, smile...
  6. scene understand - hungry dog looking at bone..
  Websites/app required by law to have ant-deepfake software (like antivirus)
  Applications:
    Driver assist to detect if driver nods off
    Autonomous stores (Amazon Go) - cameras recognized what you put in your cart
    Airport security - recognize terrorists, count people
    Gesture recognition - Xbox dancing game
    Facial recognition to unlock phone
    Smart cameras extract people & blur background
    Military - separate enemy soldiers from civilians
    Autonomous drones/cars
  Image/video apps:
    Photo smart editing - remove red eyes, beautify selfies
    Medical imaging - cancer in CT scans
    Content moderation - pornographic/violent content in social media
    Advertisement selection based on content of video
    Image search
    deep fakes - replace face in video
  Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
    modeled after visual cortex; cortical neurons respond to stimuli
      in a restricted region of the visual field
    little pre-processing; network learns to optimize the filters through   automated learning
    have problem: identifying small/thin object; ants, pant stems,
                  distorted images from digital cameras
    better than humans: small details; dog breeds, bird species
    applications:
      face recognition
      Natural language processing
      drug discovery;
         Ebola, multiple sclerosis treatment
      Checkers/Go games
  Deep fakes
    Buzzfeed & Peele 2018 Obama deep fake - "Tump is deepsh*t"
    2021 Avatarify app took selfie and made person laugh/sing
    Generative adversarial network (GAN):
      pair of adversarial deep learning neural networks:
        1. forger network: generate real-like synthetic image
        2. detective network: compare synthetic & actual image and determine is synthetic is fake
        based on feedback forger adjusts..
      can age/de-age photos, colorize black-white films, discover new drugs,
        predict climate change, predict gravitational lensing, model high-energy
        physics,
      complex GAN:
        facial expression, gait, hands/fingers, speech, vein, gestures
    By 2041 deep fake detectors common as anti-viral software
    100% detection possible by block-chain?
      but all devices cannot have block-chain
    2019 California deep fake porn law
  Human verification using bio-metrics
    AI outperforms human facial/speech recognition
    using in crime investigations should reduce crime rate
  AI security
    exploit AI decision boundaries; use sun glasses, stickers on road
    poisoning: corrupt training data

Language processing
  Natural language processing (NLP)
    Human language: speech/writing/body via social/educational environment
    Turing test - NPL being human like
    Deep learning neural networks with large data sets has gone beyond it
  Supervised NLP
    AI is provided with right answer for each input
      examples: UN multilingual translations
                speech recognition/synthesis
                optical character recognition
    complex NLP; recognition--> understanding; play Bach --> play music of Bach
      data labeling in last 20 years facilitates this
      expensive, time consuming to lable all data
      domain specific
  Self-supervised NLP
    sequence transduction neural network:  (fancy auto complete)
      input: sequence of words up to a point
      output: sequence of words after that point
    2017 Google transformer:
      sequence transduction model with selective memory
      AI can teach itself a language from scratch
    2020 Open AI GPT-3 (generative pre-trained transformer)
      super computer + 45 TB (10^12) text --> 175*10^9 parameters
        (ChatGPT 570 GB / 20*10^6 params [faster, more accurate])
      transfer learning:
        GPT-3 trained with smaller domain-specific text
      weak on knowing truth, causality, abstraction, common sense...
      TOXIC political influence engine
        much worse than Cambridge Analytica in 2016
          (200 elections around the world, with help from facebook)
  NPL platform for applications
    GPT-3 foundation ---> quick music composition, digital art (DALL.E)
      possible: senior companion, child tutors, emergency medical helpers
      write game/stock reports, summarize text
      tool for: writers, reporters, analysts.... any language worker
  Turing test, AGI (artificial general intelligence), and consciousness
    GPT-3 accurately critiques itself but is not AGI
    one large breakthrough in 60 years
      --> unlike to see AGI (need dozens of breakthroughs)
    stop using AGI
      --> AI mind is different from human mind
          AI will keep on beating humans but humans will still other tasks
          --> AI symbiosis
      AGI is narcissistic human tendency
  AI in education
    Teaching = lectures + exercises + exams + tutoring
      AI can customize all
      effective and fun
        teacher roles: mentors/connectors
          empathy, critical thinking, teamwork
          confront, comfort
          program AI

Healthcare
  Digital healthcare and AI
    life span 31/72 years in 1900/2017
    1. digitized records --> AI boom
    2. radiology, 3D  imagery
    3. wearable devices
    4. dPCR to detect viruses
    5. drug/vaccine  discovery
    Cancer cure to big - cannot use IBM Watson, need to be more modest
    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or Massive parallel sequencing:
      since 2005 up to 43 billion short reads $1K/genome
  Drug/vaccine  discovery
    1. use mRNA sequencing to find pathogens protein sequence
    2. find protein 3D structure (protein folding)
       cryo-electron microscopy - expensive may take years
    3. identify target on 3D structure
    4. generate likely treatment molecules
    phase II/II trial.. time consuming
  AI protein folding, drug discovery
    2020 DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 - AI's greatest achievement - solved 50 year problem
      trained on known structures (0.1% of important proteins)
    Given target (3D model) AI looks for an available drug
      2021 Insilico found AI drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
        saved 90% of drug cost
    NPL to mine data from research papers (steps 3&4)
      do 'in silico' experiments to find best fit
    Robotics to do in vitro trials 24/7
  Precision medicine
    radiology ophthalmology
    robot-assisted surgeries: 1.8%/15.1% 2012/2018
      colonoscopy, suturing, intestinal anatomists, teeth implants
      nanobots: DNA strands inject blood clotting drugs around tumors
    smart beds, toilets..
  Robotics
    no machine learning, slower development
    computer vision is mature
  Industrial robotics
    warehouses 100% in 20 years, factories less so
    agriculture: pick apples, lettuce....
    COVID-19: spur robotic screening, drug delivery,
  Commercial robotics
    delivery
    robotic waiters
  Digitized work
    COVID was an automation forcing event - work from home
    digitized work as input to AI
    large job displacements

Extended Reality (XR)
  Brennan  Spiegel:
    "XR is dreaming with your eyes open"
  sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch
  augmented/virtual/mixed reality (AR)/(VR)/(MR)
    VR: computer
    AR: real + computer
    MR: real + computer interaction (advanced AR)
  Six senses
    immersive: unable to distinguish real from simulated
    head mounded display (HMD)
  Microsoft hololens - 1.3 lbs  $3.5K large/dorky
    training, health care, aeronautics
    $22 billion to US army for situational awareness, info sharing
     decision making
  Google lens, snapchat glasses failed - low fidelity
  XR contact lenses
  1 cm thick VR  glasses
  haptic gloves - feel object
  somatosensory suits to fell cold/hot punched/caressed
  games/training/simulation
  scent emitters - theaters used for 100 years; pipe perfume
  taste simulator via electrodes;
     electricity, color, heat and scent
     sour and salty sensations via ion channels
     sweetness through thermal stimulating
  Input
    eye/movement/gesture tracking
    Omni-directional treadmill
    obstacles
      content creation - similar to 3D game but more complex
      nausea caused by latency
      world moving slowly - bandwidth related
  Naked-eye & brain/computer interface
    Light Field Lab naked-Eye Holograms - most natural output
    brain-computer interface - most natural input -spinal cord injuries
  Ethics with XR
    infinite memory repository
    laws for digital reincarnation
    AI+XR --> understand/amplify ourselves

Autonomous vehicles (AV)
  Google started 2011, Carnegie Mellon demo in 1991
  AV maturity ~2040
  uses neural networks
    expert rules (statistical estimation)
      expert system LISP/Prolog 1971
  Society of Automotive engineers
    LO (no automation) - human drives, AI warns human
    L1 (hand on) -AI does one task if turned on (say steering)
    L2 (hand off) -AI does multiple tasks - steer break.. human may take over
    L3 (eyes off) - AI drives, human ready to take over when AI requests
       (takeover may worse things?)
    L4 (mind off) - AI drives on AI usable environment
    L5 (steering optional) - no human required for any environment
  L0-L3 commercially available
  L4 experimental started 2018
  L5 difficult because of environment variability
     possible in augmented roads/cities - car only roads...
     6G (by 2030) enough bandwidth to allow remote takeover
  simplest AVs now: mobile robots, autonomous forklifts
  next: autonomous trucks in fixed routes - airport, mines
  L1-L3: smart park, smart-summon
  Implication of L5
    AI managed fleet for better utilization
    today 1.35m auto deaths/year
    more data--> better AI -->  greater efficiency --> reduced cost
      -->more free time --> better productivity
    less: traffic, fuel, pollution, accidents
    car economy will change as much as horse transportation did
  Non-tech obstacles
    ethics, liability, sensationalism
      trolley problem:
         kill person A, or persons B & C
         what if A is a child, your car and your child
      for humans use justice, for AI not easy;
        "explainable AI" is hard, or stupid AI WO common sense
        (AI sees drunk humans as stupid)
      Will AI fatalities be accepted, when AI reduces current deaths by 50%?
    approaches:
      1. Waymo avoid fatalities use controlled environment
      2. Tesla use AI when reasonably safe and collect data to improve it
    Liability; AI fatality responsibility:
      manufacturer? algorithm provider? human backup?
      Credit card company is accountable to fraud
        similar decision needed for AI
      Example: google ($100 billion assets) is liable
        --> field day for ambulance chasing lawyers
        2018 Uber death --> national headline
          if every AI death becomes a headline no AI & no saving million lives

Quantum computing
  80% chance of working by 2040
  new general purpose technology
  electrons/photons:
    1. superposition
       qubit be in multiple states at same time
    2. entanglement
       for connected qubits, action on one effects the other
       to double quantum computing add another qubit
  down side: extremely sensitive;
    need vacuum, low temperature..
  2/65/433 qubits in 1998/2019/2022
  4K/1M logic logic/physical qubits to break bitcoin
  decoherence errors increase as more qubits are added
  apps:
    drug discovery
    model chemical reactions

  security
    Bitcoins limited to 21M
      2023: $54.7K/coin*19M coins = $1 trillion
      inflation/quantitative easing safe
    asymmetric cryptography:
      RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman) algorithm 1K-4Kbit keys
        base on 2 large secret prime numbers (private key)
        private-->public easy
        public-->private difficult
        slow / fast for asymmetric / symmetric(more common)
      bitcoin trx = wallet address + public key (P2PK)
        after 2010, hide address (P2PKH)
        2M bitcoins with P2PK,  4M bitcoins lost ($140B)
  autonomous weapons
    Israeli Harpy drone (fire & forget)
    Slaughterbot - bird size nearly killed Venezuelan president
    Similar to AV - smart, precise, cheap, swarms...
    10K drones ($10M) wipe out half city
    problems:
      1. morality:
         machines with discretion & power to kill
      2. accountability
         when something goes wrong
      3. selective genocide
  existential threat
    many more ways to win - smallest, fastest, stealthiest...
    small counties (Israel) in an arms race
    limited by physics than AI
    nuclear weapon deterrence: MAD mutually assured destruction
    AI weapons: no MAD (no traceability)
      nuclear war triggered by terrorists using drones....
  possible solutions to AI weapons:
    1. human-in loop
       hard to enforce, big advantage loss..
    2. ban
       letter signed by Musk(?) and AI experts
         ban of chemicals, blinding lasers has worked
       problem:
         US, UK, Russia oppose it
         US National commission on AI headed by Google's Schmidt recommended no ban
    3. regulate
       complex, wishful thinking
       wage war only with robots only (not harming any humans)


AI job displacement
  routine, entry-level (cognitive/physical) jobs most at risk
    --> poor become poorer

  How AI displaces jobs
    AI advantage: detect subtle patters in large data
      example: insurance underwriting
        take over white-collar jobs; similar to data entry & bookkeeping
      robotics take over blue-collar jobs
    AI could take over 40% jobs by 2033
      Robotic process automation (RPA)
        mimic humans-software interaction --> does high-volume, repeatable tasks
        examples: resume processing payroll, web scraping, call center..
   AI displacement gradual and total
   Industrial revolution took more than 100 years to spread beyond Europe
     AI almost already adopted all across world.

  AI displacement causes serious problems
    unemployment
    fewer jobs --> lower wages
    inequality bad to worse;
      1. plutocratic AI elite
      2. small workforce with complex jobs
      3. powerless struggling masses
    loss of meaning
      industrial revolution --> work ethic; careers --> life meaning
      AI --> futility & obsolescence --> drugs, depression, suicide

  Universal basic income (UBI)
    Andrew Yang(the Freedom dividend); from taxing the ultra-rich
      only politician to see the new economy
    "give a man fish you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish you
     feed him for lifetime"
       help people use UBI to train for new jobs

  What can AI not do
    1. creativity
       AI cannot set its goals or think creatively
    2. empathy
       AI can no make people feel understood and cared for
    3. Dexterity
       precise eye-hand coordination / unknown unstructured spaces
    Asocial routine jobs: AI takes over
    Asocial creative '' : AI helps humans
    Social    ''     '' : humans shine
    Social routine jobs, AI-human collaboration - example teaching

    Cognitive:
      social
         +   creative: Merge & Acquisition (M&A) expert
         -           : artist, scientist
         +   routine : receptionist, tour guide
         -             resume matching
    Physical:
      social
         +   dexterous: elderly home caretaker
         -            : aerospace mechanic
         +   mechanical: bartender
         -             : visual inspector

  How to transform workers
    1. Relearn
       more skills;
       more healthcare workers
       volunteer jobs may become regular jobs; blood bank assistants
         elderly care, youth mentors..
    2. Re-calibrate
       train for future AI assisted jobs
         software AI tools;
           molecular simulation for pharmaceuticals,
           advertising for marketing,
           fact checking for journalist
           medial diagnosis for doctors
    3. Renaissance
       14th century Italian cities/merchants --> science & art renaissance
       AI for creativity, compassion and humanity
       big impact on education, arts, science...
       John Adams: "I study war/politics so that my sons can study
         mathematics, philosophy, commerce...
         and their children music, poetry..."

  AI economy & new social contract
    blurring of "made-up job",  "practical training", "real job"
    need astronomical money for millions of workers
    education for creative/social/multi-discipline workers
    Examples:
      "gifted and talented" (GATE) in Korea:
         teachers warned of detrimental social and emotional effects
       Massive open online courses MOOC
       Minerva school
         online seminars capped at 19 students, quiz before/after lecture
       Swiss craftsmanship culture
       Japanese excellence
      Volunteering in Canada
      Caring for elders in China
      "gross national happiness" (GNH) in Bhutan
          economic/moral metric introduced in 1970s; alternative GDP
            1. sustainable and equitable socio-economic development;
            2. environmental conservation;
            3. preservation and promotion of culture; and
            4. good governance.
          but poor Bhutan expelled Hindus (1/6 population)



AI and happiness
  Optimizing happiness is hard; problems:
    1. problem definition;
       what is happiness?
         1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1943);
            physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization
         2. Seligman's positive psychology
             Well-being: positive emotions, intense engagement, good relationships,
                         meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA)
             humanity, temperance and persistence;
               virtue ethics of Confucius, Mencius and Aristotle
    2. measurement problem
       happiness is abstract subjective...
    3. data
       need extensive personal data
       General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU law enforced 2018
       Safe storage (principal-agent have aligned interest)

  What is happiness
    for many people material wealth
    research: not so
    Hedonic (pleasure) treadmill:
      constantly adjust to a fixed level regardless of material wealth (winning lottery)
    Eudaimonic ('good spirit') happiness;
       meaningful, even if difficult to achieve;
       (growth, meaning, authenticity, excellence)
    AI may help after it understands:
      electrical (brain waves), structural (brain structures), chemical (hormones)
    Happiness is long-term;
      need new algorithms for stimulus response

  Data for AI
    Google knows more about you than you do;
      infer ethnicity, sexual orientation, what makes you angry
    GDPR
      own your personal data
      not practical - will handicap AI; no data --> stupid apps
      Alternative:
        trusted AI has all data & determines whether someone access it
        new social contract for AI

  Who to trust to store our data
    trusted AI will have more or our data than google facebook does
    data guesses our emotions even when we try to hide them
    AI owner/user conflict: user always looses
      Owners (google...) are business that optimize profit
      Users have no optimization
    Wise king may have interests that align with our:
      Frederick the great(1712 â€“ 1786):
        "My principal occupation is to enlighten minds, cultivate morality,
        and make people happy"
      enlightened kings --> age of enlightenment
    possible trusts: 1. strong leaders with popular support
                     2. digital communes - current academic projects
                     3. non-profit AI - like Wikipedia
                     4. use a block-chain - more difficult than bitcoin
      use 3rd party like we use banks....
      no experience with AI, need open mind
    Privacy computing
      supports any operations performed on private data
      1. Federate learning:
         AI training using local data & exchanging parameters;
         nobody sees or touches your data
      2. homomorphic encryption:
         data converted ciphertext that can be analyzed as if in its original form
         might work with deep learning
      3. Trusted execution environment (TEE)
         TEE decrypts data for AI training on a chip that guarantees it will not leave it

Plenitude; new economy
  1st Industrial Revolution: Coal in 1765.
  2nd: Gas in 1870.
  3rd: Electronics and Nuclear in 1969.
  4th: Internet and Renewable Energy in 2000.
       energy, material, production cost dropping

  Renewable revolution; solar/wind/batteries
    2010-2020 solar/wind/battery cost dropped 82%/46%/87%
    RethinkX
      $2T investment --> 2030 3 cents/kW-hr ?????
      zero cost super power when batteries are full ????
    100% nonrenewable --> 50% greenhouse reduction

  Material infinite supply
    dematerialization: phone/software absorbed camera, radio, maps....
    vertical farming: cheap vegetables/fruits
    synthetic biology: lab-grown meat, eliminate fertilizers
                       rubber, green chemicals
    Material genome project (2011): AI and open source methods for new materials
      artificial muscle, nano-materials

  Production; AI + automation
    self replicating/repairing robotics
    3D printing

  Plenitude
    almost free: food, water, clothes, shelter, energy
    similar to now: books, movies, music, online search
    USA: $218B food wasted, $25B to eliminate hunger
         5x houses as homeless

  Scarcity/post-scarcity models
    scarcity: wars, civilization development
    economics: limited/unlimited resources/demand
    Adam Smith:
      freedom to produce and consume --> economy balances & grows
    Karl Marx:
      increasing power of capital invalidates Adam Smith
    John Maynard Keynes:
      balance takes to long, use monetary policy
    Trekonomics:
      replicator creates anything

  Plenitude & money
    Harari in 21 lesson for 21th century:
      Human society developed on thousands of years of stories - stories we tell
      ourselves. We are the only animals that can cooperate with strangers
      because we can invent fictional stories, spread them around, and convince
      millions millions to believe in them. Money is the most successful story
      ever invented and told because it is the only story everyone believes.
    Money used for a least 7,00 years.
      stores value, facilitates exchange, safety, survival, respect, vanity,
      greed, purpose, sense of purpose.
      Story cannot be just eliminated....
    Plan:
      1. Basic life card (BLC): money only for food....
      2. Moola: new money for moving up the Maslow pyramid
         AI drives people for empathy, compassion...
         consider gaming, vanity...
      3. AI to recognize and reward respect, accomplishment, self-actualization
    Not either/or "useless class" or self-actualization
    Failure is failing to live to one's own possibilities

  Plenitude challenges
    Problems:
      1. Plenitude means price/market collapses
         Banks/stock-markets replaced
         Transitioning will be hard
      2. Companies will try to create artificial scarcity;
         De Beers released limited quantity of diamonds to keep prices up,
         and industry advertised that diamonds mean love.
         Fashion industry indoctrinates that old designs are embarrassing;
         Burberry destroyed $40M clothes.
         Microsoft charges $139 to $309 for new operating system
         $109 is same as $309 (more scarce) with features turned off.
    Disruptions --> social unrest, class polarization, revolutions
      implausible to let go of greed & vanity
      Big challenges/rewards

  After plenitude-singularity
    singularity:
      by 2045, self directed AI gains super-intelligence
      faster than we can imagine because we cannot understand exponential change
      utopias:
        solve all our problems
        become cyborg with AI
      dystopians:
        "AI is biggest risk of civilization"
        AI will control or eliminate us
    With exponential computing power we still need scientific breakthroughs
      In 65 years of AI one breakthrough - deep learning
        need dozens for super-intelligence - cannot happen

  Happy ending?
    AI:
      good: amplify capabilities, create plenitude
      bad:  biases, privacy, deep-fakes, autonomous weapons, job displacements
        Bad solved by:
          creativity, wisdom, love ...
    Paths:
      1. full fill self prophesy of becoming "useless class"
      2.
      believe that AI can help us "boldly go where no one has gone before"
    The story we write is the story of ourselves.
      The right AI-human dance --> greatest achievement in human history
