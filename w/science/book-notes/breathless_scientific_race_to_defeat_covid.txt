1. CITIZENS NEED NOT PANIC
  Worst novel virus: RNA like the flu and cornoviruses
  1,000 genome letters attaggcc... were off - Dec 2019
  promed.org - global disease reports - free, relentless, & arcane
    emailed warning Dec 30 11:59 PM
    delivery man went to hospital Dec 18, Dec 24 lung liquid sequenced
    Jan 1 Hubei health dept ordered halt to testing and destruction of samples
    secret orders for labs not to publish
  Adenine Cytosine Guanine Uracil - 4 nucleotide bases
    3 bases = 1 amino acid;  4^3=64
      61 encode amino acids and 3 specify termination of translation
        AUG (ATG in DNA): start codon, UAA, UAG, and UGA: stop codons
        20 amino acids (or 21..); 18 have codon redundancy
         2 methionine (AUG) and tryptophan (UGG) do not
        11 non-essential:nonessential amino acids:
           Alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid,
           glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine
             7 are conditional (if sick or bad diet) essential:
               arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine,
               and tyrosine
        9 essential; cannot be synthesized by human body:
           Histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
           threonine, tryptophan, and valine
           Leucine, most common = 10x more prevalent than least common: cysteine
  Jan 11 10 year old boy with lung damage and no symptoms; published Jan 24
    --> advice: wear masks, not adopted
  Jan 20: spread to Japan, Thailand, S. Korea
    Chinese declared person to person transmission

2. WARNINGS
  RNA viruses mutate more (less stable) than DNA virus
    recombine - shuffles genes - sperm/egg cells do this also
      to remove genetic debris and produce fit hybrids
      sex: produce offspring that are genetically different from parents & siblings
        adds variation and ability to evolve
      RNA do it (recombine) with other RNAs when replicating
  Virtual virus simulation parameters:
    1. rate of mutation
    2. recombine or not
    3. random or section recombination
    Optimal efficiency was similar to RN virus
  Predict virus treats (1997); criteria, does family virus:
    1. caused recent pandemics? HIV yes
    2. widespread disease in animals?
         Flu in wild birds
         Newcastle disease in chicken, canine distemper in dogs, raccons...
         mouse corona virus, feline corona virus, canine corona virus
         turkey corona virus,
         porcine (pig) epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV - fecal-oral, of fecal-nasal)
    3. evolvability - mutation speed, ease of recombination
         prone to zoonosis
  Strategy/funding for threats:
    predict-prevent versus surveillance-response;
    prediction is extremely difficult (and extremely arrogant)
  SAR-CoV 2003 - patient-->doctor (get sick and well to travel to Honk Kong)
     --> 9th floor hotels guests spread virus to Toronto Singapore & Hanoi
     neutral virus name unlike the Ebola -a river in Zaire
     asymptotic people did not transmit
     Singapore stopped spread by isolation; camera, random phone calls,
       material/financial support, fines  - not possible say in Kinshasa
  Bat viruses: rabies, Hendra Australia, Nipah Malaysia, Marbug Uganda, (Ebola suspected)
  MERS quickly spread in South Korea because first patient visited 4 hospitals
    Nosocomical spread - free national health care contributed to it.
  COVID detected Jan 21 - every day after was a day missed by US government
    Scientist knew - but president said "nobody had any idea"
    US dodged SAR-CoV, Canada & S.Korea learned from it.
  1997 Honk Kong killed 1.5M chickens;
   in few years mandated chicken vaccinations.
  Zhengli Chi 2003 - bat lady - did not find SAR-CoV in bats after 9 month search
    of fruit bats using RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction)
    convert RNA to DNA and amplify it; RNA rises & falls in hosts
    used ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, similar to rapid test):
      antibodies in blood tested with specific enzyme (another protein)
      2004 found them in horse shoe bats, got genome from feces; 92% match to Canadian
    simutaneous independent discovery by Hokong's K.Y. Yuen
    SAR-CoV has ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor
      ACE2 is attached to membrane of cells in the intestines, kidney,
      testis, gallbladder, heart and lung epithelia includes upper respiratory
      regulates of circulating angiotensin
      angiotensin is hormone (protein) that restrict bloods vessel increasing blood pressure
      ACE2 regulates blood pressure
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)
        binds to the ACE2 receptor
        1. SARS like spike proteins mounted on pseudo virus --> no bind to ACE2
        2. Replaced RBD of bat virus with RBD of SAR-CoV    --> bind; bat virus can infect humans
          --> *** Lab theory ***
      cultured 95% similar virus from bat feces - proof of reservoir
      found 293 different viruses, 9 were coronas, in multiple bat species
        --> more chance for zoonosis;
      genome of 11 viruses had SAR-CoV genetic similarity
        smoking gun of the origin of SAR-CoV
        2017 paper warned the deaf and uninterested
          the need to prepare for SARS-like virus

3. MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
   Dec 31 Chi found that SAR-CoV-2 genome did not match any of the 11 viruses
     (take her word for it!)
     "in the beginning it is not necessary to explain too much"
   SAR-CoV-2 79.5% match to SAR-CoV - decades of divergent evolution
   Publication on similarity of SAR-CoV-2 and snake & HIV genome....
   Furin cleavage site on the genome indicate easy cell entry
     Furin is  cellular endoprotease that activates proprotein substrates;
       pathogenic agents,growth factors, receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins
         protease: hydrolytic enzyme; protein turnover, growth, adaptation,
            germination,.... disease, & death
     SAR-CoV did not have the cleavage site
     Other viruses did not have such exact RBD - virus made in the lab?
       Fauci discussed as a possibility... how science works
  Malay pangolins had virus with similar RBD - made in nature not in the lab
    Pangolin scales (keratin-hair/nails) cure ant bites, evil spirits, malaria,
      pinworm, stimulate lactation in women in China
      but most pangolin skin sent to N. Ameria for boots....
      CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)
        made Asian trade illegal in 2000
        2012 Vietnam: pangolin dinner $700, served fresh  blood W alcohol
        Africa: consumed  & scales exported to China/Vietnam
        2016: CITES makes all trade illegal
        2017: China arrests for 5 tons of scales
        2019 Oct: report of corona-virus in seized pengolins
  Chinese overstated that pangolin virus was 99% match
    99% match to some parts of genome! - not overall
  Microbiome: viruses, bacteria, fungi, archaea, protozoa
  Found the RBD segment from pangolin match 97% match to SAR-CoV-2 RBD
    --> virus came from nature not the lab ... but did not have cleavage site
  March: ***6 out 9 Diamond Princess passengers with asymptotic ***
    --> 2nd warning for those that needed 2.
  Fauci steel/antifreeze in spine/veins:
    "Virologists anthropomologize... if virus was nefarious person...
     how can I do most damage? cause very little harm, give no symptoms
     to 1/2 people, and be deadly to vulnerable people"
     Virus follows 3 evolution laws:
       1. maximize copying your self
       2. extend in space
       3. extend in time
  Bad viruses: rabies, polio, ebola, measles, mumps, influenza, HIV1 & 2,
    Nipah, Hendra, Machupo, Sin Nombre,dengue, rotavirus, Zika, Yellow fever,
    Herpes B, chicken pox, hepatitis, shingles, common cold, variola (smallpox),
    SAR-Cov, MERS-CoV, OC43, SAR-Cov2
  More viruses in oceans than stars in universe, mammals have 320K types
  All animals/plants/bacteria have viral DNA in their genes
    8% of human genome is viral
  Viruses like fire is not all bad or all good.
  They give advantage or destruction.
  Stuff wrapped in capsid is genetic dispatch - a good or bad message in a botle.
  Virus evolution hypotheses:
     1. viruses first (before cells)
     2. escape - genes leaked from cells
     3. reduction - cells downsized
        support for 3: giant Mimivirus in amoeba (mimic bacteria)
          1.3M base (flue/corona/smallpox 13K/30K/19OK)
          contained enzyme genes
          descendant for extinct ancestral proto-cell
          (like birds descendants from dinosaurs)
  Multiple lineages of pangolin corona-viruses related to SAR-Cov2
    implies pangolin could have been the source facilitated by we-markets

4. MARKET DYNAMICS
  WHO team toured Huanan market - where vendors suppliers got sick,
    what the sold... and Chinese insisted touring
     seafood...
  Nov 17 Brazilian wastewater in Florianopolis was SAR-Cov2 positive
  Harvard study found crowded Wuhan hospital parking lots in August
    but was not published
  Molecular phylogenetics; HIV-1 jumped from chimp to human around 1908
    in south-east Cameroon
  OPV hypothesis: HIV spread by polio vaccine;
   Sabine live polio vaccine: attenuate virus by passing it
   through chimpanzee (which may had SIV virus) instead of monkey cells
     --> prove it by testing chimp feces for SIV
     (Sabin/Salk: attenuate/dead  oral/injection polio vaccine)
     found that SIV in east Congo (where polio was given) was not the SIV that evolved in HIV
     research died from faciparum malaria (humans are prime reservoir of malaria)
  To find source of COVID need similar phylogenetics....
    GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) has 8 million SAR-Cov2 sequences
  German patient zero variant had one nucleotide difference (out of 30K)
    Sequence tree analysis: German patient zero only had 15  infections
       and several outbreaks were successfully contained
       Washington & German containment: delayed spread by few weeks
         Washington activated hundreds of people for one case...
         big deal in a pandemic...
  Santa Clara county California
    40% immigrates - people travel...
    First US death Feb 6 - slumped in breakfast bar
    Testing first done only by CDC in Washington
      quarantine or not while waiting?
    CDC then shipped test kids which got positive results for plain water
      --> Don't look won't find
      prohibited gathering of 1,000 people then 100 then shelter in place
      when people started dying (when 96 dead in US)
  Feb 24 Dow Jones fell 1,032 points (3.5% to 28K) - March 2020 fell by 3,000
    price-weighted index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned companies trading
    on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq
  Navaro, economist, pwasteublished "Death by China" & "The coming China wars"
    Trump likes it... Feb 23: called it crisis in Fox
    Feb 24 drop --> Trump take a fit
      Nancy Messonier, CD, gave the bad news, uncertainty....
      Trump complained to Alex Azar her boss
    spread had taken off, why:
      "rugged individualism" - self concern to detriment of community
      cowboy do not wear masks
      not aligned with Trump reelection
  Dec 2019 2 virus lineages/sources:
    A Dec 20: in 1 of other 3 markets in Wuhan
    B Dec 24: Huanan market
      Wuhan 38 species sold - luxury/prestige/illegal food;
        Raccoon dogs, badgers $8/lb = 3x pork
        other factor:
          African swine fever (ASFV, DNA virus/tick vector)
          150 million pigs effected
          commodities analysts: ASFV "will lift all protein boats"
          "one pandemic lead to another" narrative; no real data
    Most recent common ancestor (MRCA) via:
      Computer analysis & simulations:
        Nov 2019 virus was circulating - not earlier than Oct
        Mar 2019 Italian report was bogus
        extinction rate of simulated lineages:
          spillovers are frequent even if pandemics are rare
          MRCA: critical point - branches diverge --> big lineage crown

4. Variables and constants
  Will the virus mutate?  All viruses mutate
    Deprive its opportunities to evolve - masks, vaccines....
  Purifying selection:
    First 9 months evolved very slowly - transmitted more than it could evolve
    RNA corona-viruses: long stable genome via nsp14 proofreading protein
    D614G: D (aspartic scid) in location 614 (spike protein) changed to G (amino acid glycine)
      loose sense of smell - early in China then Europe
  R.A. Fisher mathematized Darwin
    mathematician, statistician, biologist, geneticist, and academic - favored eugenics
    a smoker; lung cancer correlation does not imply causation
    evolution: changes in frequency of alleles (different forms of same gene)
      Peppered moths turned from white to black when trees were covered with black soot
      change of the allele population was evolution
  D614G: 10% to 67%,78% in 1,2 months - improved transmission efficiency - not lethality
  Italy:
    variant B form China not Germany
    followed WHO advice to test people linked to China
    ignored advice: first patient Feb 21 first positive test
    by June 3, 33,691 deaths - most at home?
    Does God hate Italy?
    Football match, 40K fans in Bergamo fueled spread; "no one knew virus was here"
  B1 lineage from Lombardy spread to Europe and NY
  then B1.1, B1.1.7 (UK)
    by end of 2020, UK has 250K sequences 40% of global
    variant more contagious --> lock-down
    B1.1.7 tracked was most transmissible even with masks..
    Alpha B1.1.7 Beta B1.351
  South Africa: 60 million - 7.5 million have AIDS - easier evolution of virus
  Manaus Brazil: rich people paid for opera house, poor for cathedral
    by Oct 2020 76% had antibodies (attack rate)
    heard immunity estimated 67%, but 2nd wave hit on Jan 2021
    fist wave variants not effective?, 76% was wrong? gamma more transmissible;
    24% uninfected was enough?
  India:
    similar independent mutations - had adaptive value
    convergent evolution
    Delta variant - breakthrough cases -despite vaccination
      a response to lock-downs and vaccinations
      tested positive in 4 instead of 6 days after exposure
      1,260x bigger viral loads than other variants
  Evolution happens - it is a constant

6. FOUR KINDS OF MAGIC
  1. wish it away
     "We have an incredible job - on day like a miracle it will disappear"
       didn't happen
  2. herd immunity
     Veterinarian Salmon on pigs: breed wisely, varied diet, clean sties
       "they will get power of resistance...herd immunity"
       no definition of herd immunity
      Herd immunity:
        got mathematical definition, worked well for smallpox
        not so for polio, measles, influenza
      Johnson's clear plan: self-isolate, keep infections low, buy time, no lock-down...
        suppress it - cannot eliminate it, flatten the curve
        why? scientific advisor: herd immunity (not have enough hospital beds)
      SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model:
        Epidemic does not end when susceptible is zero - forest fire does not stop
        until every tree is burned
      Basic reproduction rate (Ro): infection from the first case
      herd immunity: when R-naught < 1.0
        it worked for smallpox because it is symptomatic
        does not work for polio because it is asymptomatic
        threshold = 1 - 1/Ro  for Ro=3  threshold is 67%
      Assumptions:
        1. recovered do not become susceptible
        2. virus does not evolve
        3. homogeneous mixing; isolated groups may not immunity
        4. no immigrants - no additional susceptibles
      Measles: from rinderpest in cows for 2,000 years, Ro=12-18
        eradicated 1945-2011 with vaccine - $5.5B 2017 dollars
        measles stayed as humans only disease
        easier to control cow behavior than our own
        310K/6K 2019 cases/deaths in Democratic Congo - lack of vaccination
        1966 Rhode Island: End Measles Sunday
          Some in isolated community did not get vaccinated
          Virus brought back from Portugal a year later
      Even in ideal case herd immunity, does not makes infection zero -
         it only reduces the probability
  3. Drug therapies
    Hydroxychloroquine(malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus):
      fox news Laura Ingraham (Reagan speechwriter), Larry Ellison (Oracle)
      planted convinced Trump...
      synthetic version of quinine
      used as malaria prophylactic - parasite is poisoned by its waste as it
      grows inside a red blood cell
      chloroquine resistant malaria --> repurposed for SAR in 2003
        reduced SAE-CoV in cultured cells (in vitro; glass studies)
      Navaro praised French study (Didier Raoult- reputation of forging data),
       Fauci not impressed
       emergency use authorized, study came up negative
    Remddesivir (2009 hepatitis C virus & RSV)
      1017 effective for corona viruses
      China study: marginally effective
          study ended because of no new cases
    Ivermectin
      for parasite in people, pets cows, horses.., cheap easily accessible
      claw hammer good for carpentry not so for dentistry
      black flies gives river blindness (Onchocerciasis)
        Ivermectin is used as prophylactic
    Molnupiravir
      prodrug - taken orally - metabolized and activated
        10% of all drugs - activated in or outside the cell
      effective but mutagenic (like some cancer drugs) - cancer.... OK for elderly not so for younger
      is a nucleoside analog - mimics cytosine and uracil
        broad spectrum antiviral
  4. vaccines
     Barnie Graham workd on mRNA type vaccines for MERS and Nipah
     4 days after Jan 10 (genome release) Moderna started vaccine manufacturing
     9 weeks after first human trial
     VRC (Vaccine research center)- Graham direcor
       Clinton after Fauci presentation
       issued executive order to create VRC to create HIV vaccine
       previous RSV vaccines not so good: "vaccine-enhance disease"
       to fix that Graham had mRNA instruct creation of antigens in patients body
       problem mRNA degrades too quickly in the body
       BioNTech started work in January and in 3 months partnered with Pfizer
   Speedy vaccine: solve protein structure, design right antigen,
     coding them into synthetic mRNA, wrapping mRNA into lipid,
     to do it fast, some of this was done simultaneously
     2017 Grahan partnered with Stephan Bancel, not a scientist, CEO Moderna..
     Graham create Nipah antigen, Moderna create mRNA vacine
       2019 Nipah vaccine ready for clinical trial
    Nianshuang Wang generated genomic changes that would jam the spike on s weekend
      send sequences to company that created DNA
      used the DNA in cultured cells to create 10 types of modified spike protein
    Graham selected the most promising protein
    Nov 2020: after clinical trial 94.1 efficacy  100% against serious disease
    Dec 18 emergency use; 3,171 died of covid
    June 2021 43% Americans vaccinated 2.4% Africans

7. THE LEOPARDS OF MUMBAI
   Human viruses come from mammals & birds
     theoretically possible from reptiles, amphibians & plants
     West Nile virus found in captive snakes/alligators via mosquitoes?
   Bolivian hemorrhage fever (Manchupo virus) 5-30% mortality 1963
     Karl Johnson caught it and survived;
       found reservoir: vesper (evening) mouse - mouse urine + dust --> outbreak
       lucky that 14/17 mice had virus
   Marburg virus 1967 from African monkeys
     5/23 researchers died, In DRC up to 80% mortality in miners & families
     some virus in bats using PCR - not reservoir - virus not be grown in la
     after 41 years found 5% fruit bats had virus - virus from 5/611 bats grown in lab
       eliminated 3,000 mice in 2 weeks, imported cats
   SARA-Cov-2:
     opinion that it came from the lab or cleavage site (12 RNA letters) inserted
     but almost same 12 letters found in HKU9 bat virus
     possible the polymerase that copies the RNA bumped from one virus to another
       --> natural recombination
     Vector artificial virus to deliver
      genomes to treat human genetic disorders
     Palindrome sequence before & after cleavage site
        --> copy-choice error
     Alina Chan:
       Virus was mutating as all viruses do but it was not evolving (adapting to new host)
         did not need to evolve because it was adapted to infect humans
         Possibilities: 1. virus circulated for months before being detected
       Publish lab-origin book with science writer:
        "Viral: the search for the origin of covid-19"
                        2. adapted to humans while dwelling in bats
                        3. adapted while being studied - in human ells
    Cats get covid from the owners (globally)
      Some for minks - millions farmed and a wild mink in Utah
        minks escape from farms...
        --> sylvatic cycle (enzootic of non-human pandemic) - malaria has sylvatic (forest) cycle
      Sylvatic virus is like traveling salesman - 2 wives, 2 families...
        Yellow fever: mosquitoes spread it to humans (urban cycle) and monkeys (sylvatic cycle)
        Sylvatic SARA-Cov-2 --> no end to it...no heard immunity
        Human infection with mink (variant 5) virus --> Denmark culls 17 million minks
          Variant 5 became extinct in humans
        Late 2021 virus in wild deer in Iowa 82%, NY 30%, Illinois 67%...
        ---> generalist virus
    RaTG13
      killed 3 people in MOjjang mine in 2012
      96.2% similar to SARA-Cov-2: 50 years of evolutionary divergence
      Expert virologists: RaTG13 W/WO lab manipulation is not the source
    Gain of function
      2005 PPP (Potential Pandemic Pathogen)
        CDC reconstructed 1918 influenza virus
          from victims buried in Alaska permafrost
      2011
        creation of virulent H5N1 virus using ferrets
           -->
           paused 2014-2017
      2017
        Shi (Hu et cl) hybrid virus for 2 viruses that could not be grown
        constructed laboratory approximation (hybrid virus) of what exists in the wild
        alerted us of what exists in the wild
    Principle of parsimony (simplest explanation):
      of Occam's razor (1287–1347);
        razor: allows one to eliminate ("shave off") unlikely explanations
      “If you hear hoof-beats, think horse -- not zebra.”
      Most likely source is zoonosis
    Ascertainment bias: if you think a factor is important you will most likely
      find it because you are looking for it.
      If people thought it people thought Huanan was the source
      they would have looked harder.
      People did not suspect Huanan in the first cases.
      Cannot explain first cases if it did not start in Huanan;
        1. Dec 10 shrimp seller become sick
        2.  Dec 16accountant not having visited the market

8. NOBODY KNOWS EVERYTHING
   Egregious political malfeasance
   (bad-shocking; knowingly violate the law) political  (public official wrongdoing)
   WHO report:
     Chinese insisted that "frozen food" be likely while lab-leak was "unlikely"
             argued that live wild animals were not sold because it was illegal
     China is embarrassed and covering an animal leak - not a lab leak
       Nov. 2019 Chinese researchers reported live animals
       Jan 1 2020 market closed emptied and sterilized
       to protect politicians that looked the other way
       Illegal animal trade: $18-$75 billion/year.
    May 2021, 2 weeks after WHO report, Biden asks for report on virus origin
      result: we are not sure and we do not agree with each other
    Virus will never be eradicated:
      measles and polio are only in humans and has not been eradicated,
      will be in humans and other animals forever
    Omicron Nov 2021:
      43 mutations from Wuhan - most in spike and receptor binding domain
      strangely  no intermediary - say with half the mutations; possibilities:
        1. sparse S. African testing
        2. intermediary was in an immune compromised person
        3. sylvatic cycle - came from wildlife; similar to variant 5 in Denmark
    Did natural selection favor each amino acid changes or all as a bundle
  Bundle: "positive epistasis"
    double mutation is fitter than 2 single mutations
    "the epistatic fucking cirque du soleil of this virus is discombobulating"
      circus of sun ... confusing bewilder
  Poor man's uncertainty principle:
    scientist who knows some aspects will remain ignorant or uncertain of thers
  Faulkner:
    truth of and event or a person is fragmented
    fragments are available from diverse points of view;
    The sound and the fury
    Absalom Absalom
