Honey fungus, Armillaria, weighs hundreds of tons over 10 square kms
90% of plant depend on mycorrhizal fungi  which for a network; ""wood wide web""
Network made of many cells (hyphae)  which make up the mycelium (roots).
km rod schlture underground in Germany
Trees transfer nutrients via hte hyphae
Mushroom, the fruit, also made of hyphae.has dispure

Truffle uses chemicals to signal their readiness to be eaten
Fungi feed nematodes
Fungal computers as an environment sensors.
Lederberg's horizontal gene transfer is norm for bacteria
Lichens break up rock and when they die create soil.
Lichens like tardigrades survive space and radiation; up to 9,000 years old
Margulis endosymbiosis - one or more organisms live inside another
fungus are in roots of trees: mycorrhiza (1885)- in most vascular plants
zombie fungi; infect carpenter ants with summit disease - get to the highest point
and clamp jaws around plant - fruit mushroom and disperse spores
infected by Ophiocorprdyceps; may create ergot-like alkaloid (LSD)?
Industrial agriculture has disparate (different kind) fungus/plant ecosystems
Mycoheterotroph (other [non-photosynthesis] feeder) plants using only fungus
Example: white plant monotropa
Ecovative - make plastic, leather, and foam replacements from hyphae
Dampen book and seed it with Pleurotus mycelium, and eat oyster mushrooms
Mash pages with weak acid (cellulose to sugars) add yeast and drink beer
Radical mycology - DIY fungus projects

An Atlantic article, has the Lichens have two fungi, and one algae
ascomycetes and (newly discovered) basidiomycetes.
Lab grown lichens may now be possible
