Shane Crotty, professor of immunology ðŸ—“ 2001

Prologue
  AIDS revealed themes of: sex, death, power, money, love, hate, disease, & panic
  MIT moto: mens et manus - hands and mind
  1986 Baltimore is in charge to cure AIDS
    discovered how to detect virus
    wants to increase knowledge of biology - no cures
    discovered  reverse transcriptase: a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes
       single-stranded RNA into DNA (how retroviruses like HIV replicate)
      --> Nobel prize at 37
  arrogant, ruthless
  2000 at 62: polarized opinion about him - Baltimore affir - Imanishi-Kan fraud
