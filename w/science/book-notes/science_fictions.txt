Science fictions; fraud bias, negligence, and hype by Stuart Ritchie psychologist ðŸ—“ 2020

Preface
  Francis Bacon:
    Peculiar & perpetual error to be excited more by affirmatives than negatives
  2011 psychic powers: 1. 49.8%/53.1% correct guesses of boring/porn pictures
      --> "time traveling porn" in talk shows
    2. see 40 random words, write as many you remember, show 20 random words
       students remembered words in the 20 set
    Non reproducible results could not be published; journal had policy of
      not publishing previous experiments
    Bem (author): " I never worried about replication"
  Science article: "coping with chaos": more prejudice in messier environments
    "trash --> racism" in the papers
    suspicions: data too perfect & collected by author not students:
      Stapel: "I faked data, did not feel shame or regret",
               printed question sheets & dumped when no one was looking
  Books/media/heads filled with incorrect/exaggerated/misleading facts
  Science: Skepticism, rationality, empiricism
             --> incompetence, delusion,lies, self-deception.
           Human thing:
             irrational, bias, attention lapse, group favoritism, cheating
  Fake science --> Prescriptions, treatments, diets, purchases, public policy
  meta-science ideas to combat this

1. Ought and Is
  Science: social construct but best way of finding truth;
    social --> persuade others of your discovery;
               persuasion not always rational or objective
  Letter-writing circle of like-minded peers --> Royal society (1660)
    Newton 1643-1727
  Henry Oldenburg: theologian, diplomat, and natural philosopher
    created modern peer review, published first article in Royal society journal:
    "Philosophical transactions: Giving accompt (account) of the present undertakings,
     studies, and labours of the ingenious in many considerable parts of the world"
       May 1664 Vol 1 Issue 1: Jupiter great spot in 12 ft telescope.. red spot moved
       Journal renamed "Philosophical transactions of the Royal society"
         A/B; physical/biological
  Read journal -> find question -> make hypothesis -> get funding -> test hypothesis
     -> analyze -> publish (
                    intro[what is known, what is new],
                    method [what you did]
                    results [data, tables..]
                    discussion [what it means, speculate wildly...]
                    abstract [not behind a paywall])
     -> send to journal -> senior academic decides (Science accepts 7%) -> peer review
      (2-3 scientists, since 1970; Einstein withdrew paper because it was sent to other scientists)
       rejection reviews: "some are pleasure to read but not this one"
                          "weak as wet noodle"
                          "3 claims: know for years, decades & centuries"
                          "contributes to field's demise instead of its advancement"
                          "did you have seizure while writing sentence?"
    -> if rejected resubmit to different journal -> add to CV
  Review (Mertonian norms) rules:
    1. universalism: race gender has no effect on facts
    2. disinterestedness: scientists are not in it for the money/politics/ideology/reputation
       Darwin - "have no wishes/affections; have heart of stone"
       NOT SO: competition for grants, prestige...
    3. communality: knowledge should be shared (published)
    4. organized skepticism: not is sacred - do peer review
  Science is self correcting; Planck: "the stubborn take incorrect science to their grave"
  Replication is the key
    risk: confusion instead of enlightenment

2. Replication crisis
  Kahneman priming (Economics nobel for irrationality):
     press when you see spoon - will be faster is you see fork first
     similar with concepts - "Macbeth effect": copying unethical story make you buy soap;
     brain connects morality/cleanliness...
     --> hand-washing is ritual in many religions
     "money priming": money in screen saver makes you feel less self-sufficient
       & less caring for others (play/work alone & physical distance)
     --> threaten autonomous self-image;  "you should accept for yourself"
  Reading Florida, old, gray, wise & then walking more slowly (1996, 5K citations)
    Not repeatable in 2012; used infra-red beams instead of stop-watches
    Same for the Macbeth effect
  Kahneman 6 years after "Thinking Fast & Slow" book
    admitted "ideas were weaker than what I believed";
    damage done: people believed Nobel Laureate that they had no choice but believe
  Harvad's Amu Cuddy TED talk 2012 "power posing" increases/decreases testosterone/cortisol
    before interview expand arms/legs;
    "2 min power pose changes outcome of your life"
    "presence" book, UK conservatives politicians used it
    2015 not reproducible
  1971 Zimbardo's prison / 1960's  Milgram's obedience experiments:
    NOT replicated but
    used in Abu Ghraib trials
    Zimbardo gave sadistic instructions
  2015: 39 of 100 replication were reproduced
  2018: 62% of Nature/Science social experiments reproduced
    lot more had exaggerations
    (867 Pope Stephen dug up predecessor Formosus tried him & found him guilty)
  Failed replications continued in textbooks & cited
    --> Replication crisis
  Known replications/problems:
    2016 microeconomic: 61% replicated
    2018 neuroscience MRI experiments 90% due to image/statistical software
    Evolutionary psychology - domestication of Russian foxes exaggerated
      - sexual selection of birds - putting red band on foot...
    2020 Marine psychology - acidification does not effect fish behavior
    Organic journal rejected 7.5% of submission because of failed replication
    0.1%/1% of economics/psychology articles were replications
  Failed reproducibility (use same data set)
    tax policy vs economic growth - 22/67 reproducible, same data
    geoscience 37/39
    machine learning recommendations 7/18
  Lack of reproducibility --> 1. downgrade science reputation
    2. medical research cannot be disputable
  11%, 20% of Pre-clinical (mice/human cells) replicated
    3.4% of preclinical drugs are approved
  1/268 biomedical papers had have enough replicability info
    54% did not identify animals, chemicals..
    45% of authors did not collaborate
  "medical reversal": treatments based on non-replicable drugs
  'bispectral index monitor' in 40 million operation on 2007
    did not do anything for 'anesthesia awareness' - feeling pain
  Practices based on invalid science:
    1. Caesarean for twins is safest - no difference
    2. Children under 3 & breast feeding mothers avoiding peanuts - made worst
    3. Cooling heart arrest patient - no difference, may lead to 2nd heart attack
    4. Early mobilization and platelet transfusion for stroke patients - made worse
  45% of Cochrane reviewed treatments do not work
  ~ 1/2 pre-clinical research is treatable, $28 billions/year wasted
  52% researches think there is a replicability crisis
  90%/80%/70% of chemists/biologists/physicists-engineers experienced this
  "Why most published research findings are false" - many ways can go wrong
  Trachea (windpipe) repair: transplant, plastic, stainless steel, collagen, glass
    all failed
    Macchianiri's: seed donor's trachea with recipient's stem cells before implant
      so that it was not rejected by the immune system (2008);
      (later related to Honk-Kong regenerative medicine center)
      2011 first successful operation -> published paper WO patient dying,
      but patients died 3 months to 2 years after operation,
      Doctors became suspicious - university called police on them for privacy...
      2015 - report of guilty of scientific misconduct - on 7 papers
      Lancet editorial proclaimed innocence
      2016 Vanity fair: Macchianiri's romance with NBC reporter while married
        TV documentary 'the experiment'
        Head rolls: Karolinska vice-chancellor, dean of research,
                    chair of university board, member of Nobel committee
        Macchianiri fired/moved to Russia to do esophagus (food-pipe) work
      2017 Russia cut funding
      2018 manslaughter charges
      --> 1. trust in the science data/reports...
          2. trust in the institutions
          3. see no evil / denial attitude to science
    1974 dermatologist claimed to solve rejection problem by using black marker on white mice
    1961 fake picture of toxoplasma gondii (encephalitis/blindness) in chicken egg
    2004 South Korean Hwang cloned human, 2005 first human stem cell lines embryos
      first cloned animal - a dog; "hope of the world - dream of Korea"....
      used identical pictures for different cells
      people protested his persecution and he continues to work on stem cells
      (dog clone was real, everything else fake)
      more money spent chasing fake science than Hwang embezzled
    Southern blots - detect DNA sequence - faked by Japanese scientist
      fellow scientist hanged himself for not double checking results
    6% of published papers had fake pictures
    man is orderly animal; cannot imitate randomness in nature
      neat data --> fraud flag
    Paper retraction reasons: conflict of interest, forged authorship, misconduct, sabotage of ma
    Retraction Watch leaderboard - worst offenders;
      32 men, 1 woman, more likely Indian, Chinese, struggling with funding
      100% of acupuncture trials were effective
      Yoshitaka Fujii #1
    Fraudster: young, smart, ambitious in biology/medicine
               believe that they are injecting truth
    2001 physicist Schon published 9/7 Science/Nature articles on carbon transistor
      rumors of Nobel prize, after getting caught:
      "I made mistakes.. lack of credibility ... believe effect is real"
    Poehlman - obesity researcher fake data for 10 years- jailed
      hormone replacement injections as menopause therapy
      now works as academic adviser
    zombie papers - cite retracted papers
    1998 vaccine study by Wakefield: 12 children MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)
      causes autistic enterocolitis - 3 vaccines too much to handle
      fabricated facts;
        1. retained by lawyer to sue vaccine makers
        2.applied for patent in his single does measles vaccine
      paper funded by special trustees
        Lancet (encourages flashy findings) retracted it after 12 years
      Wakefield banned pacticing in UK, create Vaxxed film with DeNiro in US
      2018 - 140,000 people died from measles
      People still do not know who to trust

4. Bias
  "Science commits suicide when it adopts a creed" Huxley
  1840 Morton found skulls of European can contain more mustard seeds
    --> scientific racism
    1978 review of his data: shook European skulls more, selected more males;
      prior assumptions of white supremacy
  Science journals - news bias; "finding something" instead of "what happened";
    Positive versus null results: highest psychology 91.5%
      true positive - neglect false positive, false negative, true negative
    Scientists decide whether to publish
      but any good hypothesis should be published
  Publication bias or 'file-drawer problem' (where null results are kept)
  p-value (probability value): distinguish effect from chance/errors
    (sampling/measurement errors)
    Statistical z,t,chi tests
    "if hypothesis is false, probability that noise gives your results"
    p-value=0.03 for male/female height; if no height difference, 3% for height >=10 cm
  p-hacking
    do multiple tests
     and keep low p values
  1920 Fisher - statistically significant (signal not noteworthy) threshold = 0.05 (arbitrary)
    CERN Higgs boson 5 sigmas - p-value=0.000 000 3 (3x10^-5% that it was noise)
    0.05 used - "discontinuous mind" - black/white in mind versus gray in nature
    similar to when: becoming adult, species evolves, 17-degree tops-off
  True effect? (vaccine preventing death, climate change and crop yield..)
   Meta analysis:
     Effect size: effected by sampling measurement errors
       cannot rely on one study - meta analysis better than single study
       Sampling versus effect (cone shape scatter - high sample size --> accurate effect size)
          Publication bias dropped small sample/ small effect
             Ad hoc rationalization if this is dropped; small sample/ large effect should be dropped
             like archaeology - the dropping gives you info
             --> Confirmation bias (interpretation is based on belief/desire)
             Exaggerates & misleads
             31%/91% medical-journals/cancer-articles have publication bias
  Wansink: make healthy choices by adding elmo stickers to apples
    shop when not hungry.... retracted; p=0.06 asked
      p-hack: get it below 0.05
        over-fit; model randomness
          --> useless treatments/false hope
    resigned from Cornell
    Power posing author admitted p-hacking and in Twitter was a hero
  65% psychologists admitted to p-hacking
  30% biomedical researchers interpreted statistics based on expectations
  32% economists select empirical  findings that support argument
  publication bias, p-hack;
    erase data that does not fit theory
    "chrysalis effect": difference of thesis & published article
  "lost in math": non-testable string theory
  "outcome switching": a study of height versus obesity --> obesity vs TV time
  Since 2005, human trials registered before starting
    15% reported what they planned to report
  Money bias: 1/3 of medical registered trials by pharmaceutical companies
  Reputation bias: books, speeches based on good results
