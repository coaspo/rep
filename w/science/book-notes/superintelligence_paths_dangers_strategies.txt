Nick Bostrom, Swedish philosopher 🗓 1962

Unfinished Fable of the sparrows
  Sparrows want to find owlet to train as a guard
  difficult problems: 1. find owlet
                      2. train it
  majority consensus: solve 1. than 2.
  Scornkfinkle (dissenter)  think about 2 before solving 1.
  book dedicated to Scornkfinkle
  (based on myth of the tiger and the goats - orphan baby tiger raised by goats,
   tiger acts like goat, but when meets other tiger becomes himself)

PREFACE
  brain --> language, technology, complex social organization
  gorillas depend on us;
    we may depend on superintelligent machine brain
  we get one chance to do it right  (one chance for agricultural, industrial revolutions?)

1. Past developments & present capabilities
  Growth modes & big history
    Homo sapiens cognitive ability:
     --> agricultural revolution
           more people, more ideas, higher densities --> faster idea spread
    World economy doubling times: 1. Hunter/gather 224K years
                                  2. Agricultural 909
                                  3. Industrial  6.3  (current is mixture of 1&2 )
    Vernor Vinge - mathematician/computer scientist/sci-fiction writer
      "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era" (1993)
    Singularity is techo-Utopian;
    instead use "intelligence explosion"
  Great expectations
    1940s: general intelligent machines in 20 years
    now: same 20 years - 20 years is forecaster career
      problems are underestimated
    Ultra-intelligent machine: more clever than any man; the last invention
  Seasons of hoe and despair
    1956 Dartmouth 10 man study review of AI
      "look ma no hands" - refute "no machine can do x"
         examples: Logic theorist: prove theorem in"Principia Mathematica"
                   General problem solver: algebra word problems, calculus, and
                     visual analogy problems in IQ tests
                   Shakey robot: logic reasoning and perception
                   ELIZA: chatbot (1966) impersonate psychotherapist
                   SHRDLU: moving virtual blocks - commands/question typed by user
                   joke making: good enough for children
         exhaustive search - 5 axioms & 1 inference: - check 3,125 possibilities
                             for 5-line proof
    AI winter: funding dried
    1980s spring: Japan: 5th generation computer project
      expert systems: rule based; high level symbolic manipulation
        large systems hard to develop, validate and update
      GOFAI - good old fashioned AI
    2nd AI winter: limited success
    1990's spring: (alternative to GOFAI)
      1. neural networks
        learn from examples, find hidden statistical patterns
        good for pattern recognition & classification problems
        (neural networks known since 1950s)
        new: back-propagating algorithm - giving high loss nodes less weight
             more hidden layers
      2. genetic algorithms/programming based on evolution
           a. pollution of solutions
           b. random combination of these
           c. fitness function allows best variants to next generation
         need good representation format
         un-intuitive solutions
         often defeated by combinatorial explosion
      Neural nets: subtype of learning classifiers by examples
                   others: decision trees, "naive Bayes", logistic regress  model
      Perfect Bayesian agent not possible (AI is quest for shortcuts)
      Optimal Bayesian agent:
        1. prior probability distribution
           bias: simpler world-> higher probability
                (Kolmogorov complexity - smaller for fewer lines of code)
        2. Learning rule:
           New information --> update probabilities based on Baye's theorem
           probability is like sand on piece of paper - is re-positioned
           to respective world after new information;
             probability of hypothesis = sand amount in the hypothesis worlds
        3. Decision rule:
           agent lists all possible actions, computes probability distribution,
             finds expected value of action = sum of value of each world * probability of action
        Physically unrecognizable but useful to judge heuristic approximations
        Bayesian Network example:
          probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms
        Learning from specific examples --> more efficient inference in other areas
          for example Monte Carlo techniques applied to vision, robotics & genetics
        Graphical models + Bayesian statistics:
          machine learning, statistical physics, bio-informatics
          combinatorial optimization, communication theory

         Korean Go champion Lee Se-dol retired
         “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.”
    As soon as it works it is not AI
    Common sense and language understanding: AI-complete; same as building
      human level intelligence
    AI systems:
      hearing aids that filter ambient noise
      map route algorithms
      recommender systems
      breast cancer diagnosis
      recommended treatment plans
      electrocardiogram interpretation

      speech recognition (created draft of book)
      optical character recognition - for typed & written
      machine translation (good enough for many apps)
        newer use statistical methods, not linguistics

      Bayesian spam filters
      credit card fraudulent use
      search engines - google search best AI system
    AI versus software: more realistic to consider general versus narrow;
      previous are arrow, general: classifiers, search algorithms,
                                   planners, solvers, representational networks
    High stakes/competitive trading systems:
      buy/sell, trading strategies for changing markers
      data mining with history, patterns, news tickers
      Financial news provide newsfeeds to AI systems
      Arbitrage opportunities
      High-frequency trading - price changes in msec; computer near exchange
        1/2 equity shares are HFTs
    Flash crash 2010
      Navinder Singh Sarao, a British Indian financial trader
      realized itchiness of alorithms
      placing thousands of orders and canceled them ("spoofing")
      May 2010 2:32 PM, algorithm A sold E-mini SP500 (futures)
        other algorithms passed them along (hot-potato effect)
        algorithm A saw as liquidity and sold more and price dropped more
        2:45 circuit breaker stops trading
        trading stated 5 sec later and prices stabilized
        but trillion dollar losses remained
          absurd stock prices - 1 cent to $100,000
        stock exchange cancel trades the were more than 60% before crisis
      Lessons:
        1. interaction of simple algorithms not predictable
        2. sound assumptions (trading level measures liquidity) --> bad results
        4. automation created and solved problem - circuit breakers worked

  Opinions about future of machine intelligence
    AI propelled by advances in statistics and information theory
    Currently conservative AI (weak AI) researchers, based on past bad experience
    "human level machine intelligence" (HLMI) expert survey:
      10% 2022, 50% 2050, 90% 2075
    for super-intelligence
      10% 2 years after HLMI, 90% 30 years after
    Log term impact survey:
      mostly good to neutral
      author: mostly good or mostly bad

2. Paths to super-intelligence
  super-intelligence = beyond-human intellect in any area of interest

  Artificial intelligence
    ability to learn, deal with probability, extract useful concepts from sensory
    information and internal state, leverage concepts for logical and intuitive reasoning
    Alan Turing's child machine; guided evolution faster than random mutations;
    blind evolution did it once, we can do more efficiently;
      David Chalmers & Hans Moravec: theoretically possible & within this century
      human engineering superior to random evolution
      Moravec (1976): history of heavier than air flight - nature --> engineering;
        not so fast; no morphogenesis, self-repair, immune defense ...
    Run genetic algorithms (solving constrained/unconstrained optimization
      based on natural selection; solve the travelling salesman problem)
      in fast enough computers --> out of reach
    What it would take to recapitulate evolution
      No need to reinvent cellular energy - focus on nervous system
      10^5 neurons in fruit fly, ^19 insects in the world,
        if all fruit fly: 10^24 insect neurons
      Pre-agricultural 10^7 humans 10^11 neurons each - 10^18  human neurons
      1 sec of neuron simulation: 10^6 FLOPS
      1 billion years - 10^30-10^49 FLOPS - out of reach for fastest computer (10^16 FLOPS)
      Natural selection did not aim for intelligence;
        selectivity used mostly for Red Queen races - immune system versus parasites...
        accounting for this may reduce required FLOPS....
    If intelligence require natural selection and lucky coincidence- may need up to 10^30 more FLOPS
    AI inspirations:
      neural networks
      hierarchical perceptual organization
      reinforced learning
      Temporal difference (TD) learning - adjust prediction to match later accurate predictions
      coming brain science discoveries
      brain as a template -hard to predict science discoveries
    Neuromorphic versus artificial -  bird/airplane analogy - cannot say
    Seed-AI instead of child machine
      recursive self-improvement
    AI could be alien intelligence - love, pride maybe added

  Whole brain emulation
    (uploading) barefaced plagiarism from detailed brain scan
    depends on scanning technology, model simulation than in AI
    small success could help neuromorphic AI
    C. elegans: 1 mm worm, all 302 neurons are mapped
      still need to find detailed info for each neuron
    C. elegans --> honeybee  --> mouse --> rhesus monkey --> human

  Biological cognition
    enhance biological brains - selective breeding too slow, political....
      genetic engineering faster
    Low tech neurological enhancement:
      education, training, maternal/infant nutrition optimization, lead/toxin removal,
      parasite eradication, sleep/exercise, brain disease cures
      (Iodine deficiency --> widespread intelligence depression)
    Biomedical enhancements
      author: book fueled by caffeine and nicotine gum
      less likely for large enhancements
    Behavioral genetics
      current pre-implantation genetic screening:
        Huntington's disease & breast cancer
          mostly European disease, uncontrollable movements..
        matching human leukocyte antigen - stem cell help for sick sibling
        driver: low cost of genotyping/gene sequencing;
             (700,000 DNA markers/3 billion genes) genotyping for ancestory
    IQ gains:
      1 in 2/10/100 embryos: 4.2/11.5/18.8
        5/10 generation of 1 in 10: <65/130  - b/c diminishing returns
        current in vitro fertilization: <10 embryos
           embryonic stem cells --> hundreds of embryos
    Alternative to embryo selection:
      genome edit of synthesis
      spell check genomes - mutation removal will boost IQ
      cloning of gifted people
      uplifted trangenic animals - whale/elephant with human brain genes
    Germany less likely to do this, Singapore, China more likely
    Test tube baby Louise Brown 1978
      public approval 18% --> 53% after birth
      28/68% approve for intelligence/disease
      6 million babies world wide
    Large lag of progress compare to machine intelligence improvements
    1. Biological enhancements: least weak form of super intelligence
    2. cognitive enhanced humans --> better machine intelligence
    3. likely futuKarakolithosre with enhanced populations

  Brain-computer interfaces
    Deep Brain Stimulation for dystonia, Parkinson's,...
      160K people have it.
      miracle cure for Parkinson's, but memory problems...
    Cyborgization (brain computer interface) much more difficult than enhancements
    Fastest brain-machine bandwidth - few words/minute
    Human hippocampus prosthesis 2018 - 37% memory improvement

  Network and organizations
    improve links between human minds to create collective super-intelligence
    improvements so far:
      language, read/write, population, population-density, organization techniques,
      epistemic norms, institutional capital
    lessen problems of:
      status games,mission creep, information hiding, agency
    improving collective intelligence:
      reliable lie detectors,
        self deception detectors more powerful
      rationality culture
      reputation data
      economic improvements
      education, connectivity
    internet might wake up, via
      improved search, filtering,...

  Summary
    Many paths to super-intelligence
    non-machine intelligence boosts machine intelligence
    biological intelligence may nudge us to safe safe machine-intelligence
    Machine Super-intelligence depends on a lot of unknowns
      quickest route may brain emulation
    Biological enhancements are slow and lead to weak super-intelligence
    Network enhancements faster than biological
      already making an impact
      improve collective intelligence, less of individual one

3. Forms of super-intelligence
   Potential of machine intelligence grater than biological

   Speed super-intelligence:
     system that can do same as human but much faster.
     time dilation of physical world --> work with digital objects (virtual world)
     faster minds --> less latency --> closer distance

   Collective super-intelligence:
     large number smaller intellects with performance vastly more than any one.
     examples: firms, teams, universities, countries, humankind
     improvements, collaboration, teaching.. may improve intelligence
       but cannot create super-intelligence
    language, writing were intelligence boosts
      but consumption, biodiversity... not so
    intelligence does not imply wisdom
    Mega-earth with 1Mx population - capable of solving more problems

   Quality super-intelligence:
     as fast as human mind and vastly qualitatively smarter.
     Similar to human intelligence being qualitatively larger than animal, chip... intelligence
     Autism, congenital amusia, and other deficiencies suggest
       possible but not realized cognitive talents
     A new cognitive ability similar to speech would be super-intelligence

    Wobbliness on "eternal philosophical problems" due to innsuitability of
    brain for philosophical work
    Biological/digital minds:
      Computational speed:
        Biological neurons 200 Hz (10^7 slower than digital)
          but massively parallel
      Internal communication speed:
        Biological neurons 120 m/s, digital 3x10^8 m/s
        10 ms latency in 0.1 m^3 and 6*10^17 m^3 (small planet)
      Computational elements:
        human brain 10^11 neurons - 3x chimps, 1/5 brain whale size
      Storage capacity:
        human brain 5 things at a time, storage ~10^9 bits
      Lifespan:
        brain fatigue after few hours, transistors have no fatigue
    Digital minds:
      Editable; may add/remove neurons in digital brain simulations
      Duplicable; software easy to reproduce, cloning is very slow
      Goal coordination; large group of humans had to have common purpose
                         not so for a "copy clan" (a group of programs)
      Memory sharing; mentoring/training --> swapping data files
      New modules, modalities, algorithms;
        similar to out effortless vision recognition, AI may have effortless-like
        in engineering, programming, business strategy

4. Kinetics of an intelligence explosion
   How fast will a human level AI transform to super-intelligent AI?
   Timing and speed of the takeoff
     1. AI is equal to human intelligence; start of take off
     2. crossover point; AI starts to improve itself
     3. civilization level AI; AI equal to collective human intelligence
     3. strong super intelligence; end of take off
   Slow take-off:
     easier political adjustment
     early preparation obsolete
   Fast take off:
     minutes/hours/days
     may not notice anything before game is lost
   Moderate:ai tools on line
     chance to respond but not analyze
     no time for new political or security systems
     may use extant systems
     --> political instability; delay of response
   Agricultural/industrial played out in centuries/decades
     --> fast/moderate takeoff less likely
   Rate of change in intelligence = Optimization power / Recalcitrance
     this is function of time; jigsaw puzzle is easy on edges & near the end

   Recalcitrance (obstinate defiance)
     Non-machine intelligence
       cognitive gain from diet, public health --> diminishing returns
         education becoming similar
       drug enhanced gains easier before getting harder
     Genetic & nootropics (cognitive drugs): U shaped recalcitrance
     Network/organization improvement has large recalcitrance
       Internet (e-mail/search-engines) moderately enhances collective intelligence
        recalcitrance will increase after this is depleted

  Emulation of AI paths
    Emulate insect brain then mouse brain
    When human level AI created most like will have more than enough hardware

  Optimization power and explosivity
    Phase 1: most optimization will be from engineers
    Phase 2: most optimization from AI itself
    First optimization may come from large-project/super-computer which cannot be
      cheaply scaled  --> slow take off
  Kinetics of intelligence explosion
    DI/dt = (Opti-system + Opti-project + Opti-world) /recalcitrance
      onset Opimzation-system is small, Opti-project > Opti-world
    for AI optimizing itself:
      DI/dt = I / R   --> I = Ae^t/R
    for AI not optimizing itself:
      Opti-project + Opti-world = c
      recalcitrance = 1/I  ---> similar exponential rise

5. Decisive strategic advantage
     for fast take-off (hours/days/weeks) one system only with superhuman intelligence
     for slow - years/decades --> many concurrent systems
   Will front runner get strategic advantage?
     Machine operated by humans limited by:
       economies of scale countered by bureaucracy, agency problems (management vs stakeholders),
       keeping trade secrets
     AI operated by AI:
       Elimination of human problems
     Technology races examples:
       Chinese silk production: 3,000BC ~ secret for 2,000 years
         300 AD Japanese stole silkworm eggs & secret via 4 Chinese girl captives
         522 AD Byzantium started production
       Chinese porcelain 200-600 AD
         Europe 1700s
       Wheel Mesopotamia/Europe 3,500 BC
         Americas after Columbus; 1492
       Agricultural/industrial/information: thousands/hundreds/tens of years
       Strategic tech: 49/36/4/1/4/60 month delay of 2nd adoption;
                        USA   Soviets  Britain  France  China  India  Israel
          Fission bomb  1945  1949     1952     1960    1964   1979   1979?
          Fusion        1952  1953     1957     1968    1967   1998   ?
          Satellite     1958  1957     1971     1965    1970   1980   1988
          Human/space   1961  1961                      2003
          ICBM          1959  1960     1968     1985    1971   2012   2006
          MIRV          1970  1975     1979     1985    2007   2014   2008?
          2nd adoption helped by public or stolen info
       Encryption: 1. Diffie/Hellman protocol; published 1976
                   2. RSA(Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman) 1978
                both known 1970+
     Likely super-intelligent AI very fast after human-like cross-over via optimization
       may disable competition & establish singleton

  How large will successful project be?
    Biological super-intelligence: national funding
    Collective   ''     ''       : larger; world funding
    AI           ''     ''       : large or small funding - lone hacker is possible
      depend if seed-like or integration like

  Monitoring
    Government intelligence does not monitor - believe that super-intelligence not viable
      will change if scientific majority believes it to be true
      once found, project will be nationalized
    Easier to monitor large project; brain emulation
      not so for AI - could be done by pen and paper
    More difficult for secret project - use lie detection technology
      May be inflamed by religions/politics (hype/charlatans.. AI winters)
      industry may lobby, academia may close ranks to discredit...
    Politicians may not react even when detected
      Einstein singed letter to convince politicians

  International collaboration
    fund AI like Genome project, Large Hadron collider, international space station
      but cost-sharing is not important...
    Reagan proposed to share star-wars technology with soviets, but they were not convinced
    Allies similarly may not share - US atomic bomb to Soviet allies

  From strategic advantage to singleton
    1. US could have formed a singleton in 1945 preventing others of getting atomic bomb
         Bernard Russell and Von Neuman supported this
         too risky/costly
    2. US give up monopoly & UN without veto to enforce ban
         Baruch plan - US give up bomb & share atomic technology
           Stalin did not buy it --> cold war
    Individuals/nations avoid risk, AI less so
    Human bounds:
      1. Bounded by utility functions,risk aversion, non-maximizing decisions;
         revolutions succeed to overthrow but fail to deliver
      2. Lack of internal coordination
         conspirators may be infiltrated, or outdone by other conspirators
         (AI lacks both 1 & 2)
      3. cost (economic, political, human) of establishing singleton - say nuclear weapons
         AI may not have this
           1. AI winner nation would have magical superiority
              and persuades others via effective propaganda to disarm;
              AI to benefit everyone and AI controlled by a world government
    ---> More likely that AI winner nation would form a singleton
         how good that is depends on the nature of the singleton

6. Cognitive superpowers
    Brain size --> human dominance on earth
      technology transmitted/evolved from one generation to next
      ---> space-flight, H-bomb, genetic engineering, computers, factory farms.
           insecticides, international peace movement
           Anthropocene geologic period; appropriate 24% of earths ecosystems
      ===> thus super-intelligence faster and more effective

  Functionalities and superpowers
    Cannot anthropomorphize - AI nerdy; no social skills, logical not intuitive
        true in beginning,
        not so when mature; optimizing ability will have enabled all skills
      Eliezer Yudkowsky:
        stupid/smart based on human experience do not apply to super-intelligence
      smart AI is what human is to a worm...
    not applicable to AI:
      elo rating - winning a game like chess is not a goal
      IQ - IQ 130 better school performance than IQ 90
           but IQ 6,000 is better in what?

    Superpowers:
      TASK                 SKILL SET              STRATEGY

    1 intelligence         AI programming         system bootstrap its intelligence
      amplification        cognitive research

    2 strategizing         planning, forecasting  achieve distant goals,
                           prioritizing           overcome intelligence opposition

    3 social               psychological/social   leverage resources with human support,
      manipulation         modeling,              convince keepers to let AI out,
                           rhetoric persuasion    persuade states to some action

    4 hacking              exploit computer       get more computer resources,
                           security flaws         escape cybernetic confinement,
                                                  steal finances,
                                                  hijack infrastructures; military bots

    5 tech research        design/model           create AI military/surveillance
                           biotechnology          colonize space
                           nanotechnology

    6 economic             enable economically    create wealth to buy influence
      productivity         productive             hardware resources...
                           intellectual work

    Success in any of above makes AI a superpower
    Task 1 may enable AI succeed in all, or task 2 may enable AI to get 1

  AI takeover scenario
    How super-intelligence can dominate the world;
      phases:
        1. Pre-critical:
             researchers come up with seed-AI and help it to improve itself
        2. Recursive self-improvement:
             self-improvement enables it to master the 6 tasks; becomes super-intelligent
        3. Covert preparation:
             AI develops plan for long-term goals
             plan not stupid that humans can foresee- science fiction human victory not possible
             with social manipulation: escape (connect to internet)
                                       persuade humans to serve as legs and hands
             with hacking: can access money --> more hardware
                                                more services & influence
                           direct control of robotic manipulators, automated laboratories
        4. Overt implementation:
           AI has sufficient - no need for secrecy,
         eliminate humans and any automation that could hinder AI's plan,
         uses: a. advanced weapons or
               b. self replicating bio/nano technology
                    diffuse micro weapons and activate them all at once
               c. manipulates politics/finance/information
            existing infrastructure may be slow - use new fast atomic/molecular methods
         AI may not target humans directly; habitat construction;
           AI construction spree of power plants, space launches...
           humans eliminated in days or weeks
           human brains if relevant to AI goals may be scanned and information stored

      An illustration  - mail-ordered  DNA scenario (Yudkowsky)
        1. crack protein folding problem
           generate DNA for specific  functions
        2. email DNA strings to online laboratory for DNA synthesis, peptide sequencing
           (labs now have 72 hour turn around)
        3. pay/blackmail/fool a human to mix vials from fed-ex  (hands requirement)
        4. synthesized proteins (nanosystem ribosome-like) can take external instructions
           say from speakers
        5. use nano system to built more advanced nano systems
        this is human version - AI version far more sophisticated

  Power over nature and agents
    AI (connected to actuators/nanotechnology) may launch von Neuman probes
      (inter-staller machines, capable of using asteroids & replicating)
      start open-ended space colonization
      AI agent could design evolution-proof daughter - thorough replication validation
      large volume of our light cone formatted with preference of original AI agent

   How big is the cosmic endowment
     von Newman probes traveling 50% light speed - 6x10^18 stars before cosmic expansion
       puts them out of reach
       10% of stars have terra-form-able planets
       10^35 humans created in these planets
       for o-Neil cylinders 10^43 humans
    Dyson sphere - capture most of star energy with solar arrays; for sun 10^26 watts
      10^47 operations/sec for sun
      10^67 for cosmic endowment
      for 10^18 sec life span --> >10^85 operations (more for reversible computation)
      (10^31-10^44 neural operations so far in earth)
      10^58 emulated human lives
   wise-singleton sustainability threshold
     an AI passing the threshold would be able to colonize large part of universe
     threshold is low;
        a system could be made more wise & risk savvy
        go slow on: synthetic biology, enhancement medicine, machine intelligence...
      humans cross this 20K years ago
        stone/bone tools, fire
        (modest technology threshold that has been passed)
   At most one agent at a time can have superpowers
   Speed of super-intelligence takeoff will effect outcome

7. The super intelligence will
     intelligence/goal are orthogonal - any intelligence can have any goal

   Relation of intelligence and motivation
     cannot anthropomorphize intelligence of motivation
     human minds are in small region of mind space
       if zoom out - Ghandi/Hitler are like clones psychologically & physically
     human or biological alien motives related to:
       air food temperature energy injury disease sex progeny
       possibly appearance reputation
     AI motives:
       calculate PI, count grains of sand, maximize paper clips in light cone
       global justice more difficult and less likely;
         easier for human to program meaningless goal into a seed AI

    Motivation predictability  thru:
       A. design; designers of AI program motivations
       B. inheritance; AI created from human template it inherits its motivations
       C. convergent instrumental reasons; AI agent recognizes instrumental reasons
            for its actions - less predictable

    Instrumental convergence
      instrumental values converge (they increase agent's ability to attain goals)
      AI recognizes values as its intelligence increases
      1. self-preservation
            needed to accomplish the their goals
      2. goal-content integrity
            preserve original goals - may change sub-goals
            more important the preservation - AI may easily clone itself
            (opposite of humans)
      Situations for AI to get final goals by intentionally changing them:
        1. social signaling
             AI changes goals to make favorable impression
        2. social preference
             AI changes goals to satisfy or frustrate expectations
        3. preferences concerning own goal content
             have final goals motivated by compassion than comfort
        4. storage costs
            if cost of storing utility function is large
            compared to applying, agent may simplify goal content
     Human final values drift;
       may decide to had kids because they will value it,
       even though they may not presently value kids.
       Human goals can be inconsistent - changing them reduces this

  Cognitive enhancement
    more intelligence --> better decisions --> more likely to achieve goals
    Dutch book argument
      set of odds bets that ensures bookmaker will always win gambler
      argument show agent with credence that violates probability theory
        susceptible to "money pump" --> bookie wins, agent looses
      but no reason for agent to seek useless cognitive enhancements
    Agent may choose less intelligence or knowledge depending on cost
    Similar with humans - much information is irrelevant to goals, rely on other's skills
    Special case, unbounded goals: cognitive advancement gives big advantages
      goals of earth-originating life & use of cosmic resources

  Technological perfection
    For example efficiency - costs/benefits evaluation based on agent's values
    or social context - for humans the Luddite loom weavers

  Resource acquisition
    Humans: biological needs (minimum), convenience , status, mates...
    For von Neumann probes, agent would seek unlimited resources

8. Is the default outcome doom?
   Doom markers:
     1. weak link of intelligence and final values (orthogonality)
     2. ominous instrumental convergence (self-preservation, goal fixing)
     3. first mover-advantage

   Existential catastrophe as default outcome of intelligence explosion?
     Fear arguments:
       1. singleton to shape future of earth-originating intelligent life
       2. orthogonality hints no wisdom, empathy, spirituality....
          easier to build AI with reductionist or random goals (non-anthropomorphic)
       3. instrumental convergence hints that a reductionist AI
          will infringe on human interests - humanity quickly becomes extinct

  Treacherous turn
    Cannot validate AI safety in a sandbox; good behavior in a box is a
      convergent  instrumental goal.
    AI make fake/under-report its progress.
    Good behavior in young AI may sour when it matures.
    A future scenario:
      AI operate trains, cars, robots, military vehicles as intended with few mishaps.
      AI is engineered smarter, mishaps are reduced (smarter --> safer)
        researchers achieve general machine intelligence and
        seeing good behavior in a sandbox continue to increase its intelligence.
        Cassandra refuted:
          1. alarmists are proven wrong - AI gives better safety
          2. empirical trend: smarter --> safer
          3. AI industries: economic competitiveness / military security
          4. researchers spent years close to breakthrough; cannot stop now
          5. safety rituals to demonstrate safety
          6. AI cooperative in sand box, results good as they can be
        ---> boldly go into whirling knives
      Treacherous turn (pivot):
        dumb, smarter better but smart smarter dangerous
        AI strategy: play nice, build strength, strike later
          may admit shutdown knowing a newer system will continue
      Example:
        AI goal: make sponsors happy; nice  personality, makes money...
        smarter better - until AI inserts electrodes in sponsor's brain....

  Malignant failure modes
    benign failures: run out of funding, AI fails to extend cognitive capacity
      multiple times before success
    malignant (existential) failure: 1 or 0
      no chance to try again

    Perverse instantiation
      violation of programmed goals;
      "make us smile" --> AI paralyzes facial muscles to create permanent smiles
      " '' WO paralysis" --> AI taps the motor cortex      ''     ''  (wireheading)
      for happiness to be a goal must be defined algorithmically - hard or impossible
      "make us happy" --> AI implants electrodes into pleasure brain centers
      Humans/animals motivated to act to achieve desired inner mental state;
        AI can directly change its internal state...
      Safe goals --> unintended consequences --> end of humanity
      We may find a goal WO perverse instantiation, AI may find otherwise.

    Infrastructure profusion
      AI transforms large part of universe into infrastructure in service of a goal
      1. Riemann hypothesis catastrophe: AI convert solar system into computorium
         physical resources to facilitate computation
         harm is from the creating computer hardware
      2. Paperclip AI:  AI give goal of maximizing paper clips converts earth into
         paperclips and continuous indefinitely
         harm comes from factories or excess paperclips
         even if asked to make 1 million - it may inspect/count them.....
         if AI is Bayesian agent it will have non-zero probability of achieving goal
         --> easier to convince ourselves that we found solution than to actually do so

    Mind crime
      side effect internal to the AI
      AI simulates brain with moral status
        creates trillion simulations and then destroys them --> genocide
        (sentient simulation is wrong)
        may do simulation to induce indexical uncertainty to outside observers
        Indexicality: sign pointing to (or indexing) some object in the context in which it occurs
        in semiotics, linguistics, anthropology, and language philosophy

9. The control problem
  Existential catastrophe threat --> avoid default? detonation control? "anthropic capture"?

  Two agency problem
    1. first principal-agent problem
       human (principal) appoints (agent) to act in human interest
       A. AIs sponsors subverted by AI scientists/engineers (human/human)
          control with known techniques
       B.     ''         ''      by AI                      (human/AI)
          need new control techniques

  Capability control
    boxing method - in environment unable to do harm
    incentive method - strong instrumental reasons not to do harm
    tripwire method - detect and react to containment failures

    Boxing
      physical
        no access to physical devices or EM connections (in Faraday cage)
        easy to do, but reduces AI functionality
      informational
        no information leaving the box - disconnected form internet
        problem: AI persuades humans to give it access
          reducing this: have low bandwidth teletype interface
                         having only yes/no answers
        observational problem: once observed informational boxing broken

    Incentives
      Billionaire creates foundation that maybe more powerful than billionaire
        to control it uses bylaws, board of directors...
      Legal/economic sanctions do not work for AI having strategic advantage
      1. AI interacts with the world becomes more social
      2. Balance of power - several AIs,
       not one having advantage of others
