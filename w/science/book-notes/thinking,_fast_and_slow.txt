Daniel Kahneman  Princeton psychology professor  ðŸ—“ 2011
Pseudo-science alert:
  Priming effect listed below, according to 'science fictions' book cannot be replicated.
  How many others listed are irreplicable?

Intro:
  Goal to enrich vocabulary & discussion of judgment/choices of others
    --> understand biases of intuition in others & ourselves
  example: "hallo effect" for the bias to favor handsome/confident speaker;
            easier to anticipate, recognize & understand
  People are natural grammarians, but qualified no statisticians
    even professional statisticians are not good intuitive statisticians
  Steve is shy and withdrawn - is he farmer or librarian;
    bias for librarian; but framer more likely because 20x more common
    --> resemblance is the simplifying heuristic (rule of thumb)
    heuristic:  mental shortcut to quick & efficient solutions/judgments
  1. What is rate divorces - ease of memory search; people you know.
  2. Adultery more common in politicians? power is an aphrodisiac & away from home
     no so - more reports on politician than doctors - reporter's choice
     1. & 2. --> availability heuristic
  1970's social science: 1. people are rational with sound reasoning.
                         2. fear, hate... emotions are not rational
  Now: irrational thinking caused by faulty cognition not emotions
  "Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics & biases" outside psychology:
     medical diagnosis, legal system, intelligence analysis, philosophy,
     statistics, military strategy, economics
     Mind is susceptible to systematic errors
  "Prospect Theory: Analysis of decision under risk":
     behavioral economics
  Expert accurate intuition due to prolonged practice not heuristics.
    but not always; stockbroker using affect heuristic (like/dislike WO reasoning)
                    replace complex question with easier one
  Neither (fast) expert or heuristic solution --> switch to slow deliberate thinking

______________________________PART 1 TWO SYSTEMS________________________________
1. Characters of the story:
   Fast/slow: picture of angry person/multiplying 2 numbers --> System 1/2;
     No effort, no control, impulsive / effort, concentration, algorithmic, lazy
   System 1:
     detect object distance
     orient to source of sound
     complete sentence "bread and ___"
     make disgusted face when shown something horrible
     drive car on empty road
     understand simple sentences
   System 2:
     brace for starter gun in race
     focus on circus clowns
     search memory to identify sound
     tell your phone number
     fill out a form
   Limited budget of attention;
     car passenger stop talking when driver is passing truck
     "invisible gorilla": intense focusing makes you blind
       1/2 people do not see gorilla in video
   Most of what you think (system 2) originates from system 1
   Have both visual illusion & cognitive illusions;
     Patient shares with you mistakes of psychiatric treatment & tells you
     that you are different  --> do not treat him, he is psychopath
       Sympathy coming from system 1 not controllable
       System 2 was trained to reject it
   Train system 2 to recognize when system 1 mistakes are likely;
     easier to see others mistakes than own

2. Attention and effort:
  Limit: Add 3 to each digit of a number: pupils +50% and heart rate +7beats
  Make if harder person gives up & pupils shrink
    "cognitive pupillometry" --> measure system 1 activity
  "law of least action" : physical & mental
  System 2 uses "task sets" and adopts/terminates them via "executive control"
  Ability to to switch tasks involving memory indicates general intelligence
  Ability to control attention predicts performance of pilots...

3. The lazy controller
  If walking & asked to multiply numbers will stop, sitting better than standing
  but not slow thing is intense...
  "Flow": deep effortless concentration, loose sense of time, place, self, problems
          --> pure joy; "optimal experience"; painting, motorcycle riding, writing book...
  Challenged with cognitive task & temptation
    (multiply number and offered chocolate/fruit, will choose chocolate;
     System 1 more influence on behavior when system 2 is busy and has sweet tooth)
  Cognitive busy --> likely to give to temptation, be selfish/sexist/superficial
  All voluntary efforts (cognitive/physical/emotional) use shared mental energy.
    energy is glucose
  "Ego depletion": when forced to use self control, less willing to do it again
      emotional effort reduces physical performance
      select carrot instead of chocolate, reduces cognitive performance
      undone by eating sugar; verified with glucose/splenda drink between tasks
      tired
      /hungry judges grant fewer paroles
  Self control depleting (conflict) tasks:
    inhibit emotions to a movie
    make choice involving conflict
    trying to impress others
    interact with person of different race
  Markers of depletion:
    deviate from  ones diet
    impulsive buying
    be provocative or aggressive
    persist less time in hand-grip task
    perform poorly in cognitive test
  Bat and ball problem:
    Bat and ball cost $1.10
    Bat costs one more dollar than ball
    How much ball costs
      50% MIT student wrong (lazy) ($0.10), 80% of other students wrong
      System 1 wrong endorsed by lazy system 2
  Rose problem:
    all roses are flowers
    Some flowers fade quickly
    Thus some rose fade quickly
      majority students wrong System 1 (true)
  How many murders/year in Michigan?
    will underestimate if miss to note Detroit, blame system 1 & 2
  4-year old's - One cookie now, or 2 cookies in 15 min
    more self-control --> more intelligent as young adults
    Experiment: improved self-control --> improve intelligence months later
  Intelligent: switch tasks quickly & efficiently
  Rational: non-lazy system 2 ; engaged

4. Associative machine
  Look at:   Bananas  Vomit        (Associative activation)
    --> experience automatically unpleasant images/memories via System 1
    react physically - cognition is embodied - think with brain & body
  Association: concrete, abstract, noun, verb, adjective, or clenched fist
    ideas are node in network; virus-->cold, banana-->fruit
    one idea activates others, only few are registered
  Marvels of priming:
    Hear wash/eat fill so_p as soap/soup - primed for other related .../...
    Florida or ideomotor effect:
      Reconstruct sentences containing: gray, Florida, wrinkled, bald, forgetful
      and walk to next class room --> walking was slower
      Reverse: walk 5 min 1/3 normal pace --> quicker to recognize old, lonely....
    hold pencil with teeth tip pointing out (smile) rate cartoon funnier
      parallel to lips (frown) rate cartoon less funny
    if you nod/shake head --> more likely to accept/reject opinion
      "act calm and kind regardless of how you feel"
  Primes that guide us:
    Voting for school funding increases if polling done in schools
    Money primed people (dollars in screen saver)--> individualism;
             try harder, more selfish, be alone, 38 cm further apart
  "I made myself smile and I feel better"

4. Cognitive ease
     when relaxed, trust intuition, familiar situation
     Repeated experience, clear display, primed idea, good mood ---> ease
        --> feels: familiar, true, good, effortless
   cognitive strain: vigilant, suspicious, make less errors, less creative/intuitive
   Illusions of remembering:
     see a random name, a few days later it will be  more familiar with out
       remember why, if names are blurred it will be clearer
   Illusions of truth:
     Repetition will make people believe in falsehood, because familiarity is
       not easily distinguished from truth - dictators/marketers know this
       example: repeated exposure to "body temperature of chicken" more
         likely to agree that it is 144 F
   How to write persuasive message:
     use bold, bright blue/red, simple, rhyming
     --> because system 2 is lazy, stay away from anything difficult
     (message still has to make sense...)
     if motivated can overcome superficial factors that create illusion of truth
   Strain and effort:
     cognitive strain mobilizes system 2; a poorly legible riddle
   Please of cognitive ease:
     Investors believe that stock with fluent names earn higher returns
     Mere exposure effect: more repeated words/pictures are more favored
       even when shown quickly & observers are not aware of them
       similar with animals - biological effect that improves survival
     cognitive ease --> positive emotion
   Ease mood and intuition:
     Unhappy & uncomfortable --> poor intuition (system 1)
     Clusters:
      1. good mood/intuition/creativity/gullibility/reliance on system 1
      2. sadness/vigilance/suspicion/analytic approach (system2)
   Familiarity breed likes
   Good mood --> strong/weak system 1/2

5. Norms, Surprises, and causes
  System 1 main function: update a model of your personal world;
    associations that link: ideas or circumstance, events, actions, outcomes
    notice one strange event, more like to notice others and link them
    Moses illusion: "how many animals of each kind did Moses take into ark?"
      Very few people see what's wrong - Noah not Moses...
        Norm theory: Moses/Noah both in bible, same vowel, same syllables
          --> cognitive ease  (Moses ---> Bush:  illusion --> joke)
    "Earth revolves around the trouble every year"
      --> distinct brain activity in 1/5 sec;  violates the norm
    News headlines satisfy our need for coherence; large event must have consequences
    1. Physical causality: do not infer it from repeated observation - see it like color
      6 month babies do this
    2. Intentional causality: we identify personality traits & intentions
      < 1 yr babies can identify bully & victim
    System 1 has religion built-in; we inherently 1 & 2
    Mind metaphor: traits/intentions or mechanic regulations (associative machine)

      psychology of causality: no need to be convince they are not real

7. Machine for jumping to conclusions
  System 1 jumps to conclusions to save time/effort if chance of error is acceptable.
    Ann approached the bank. - money bank first, but it could be river bank
      System 1/2 unaware/aware of uncertainty
  Bias to believe and confirm:
    Science test hypothesis by trying to refute it
    System 2 (& scientists) seek data to confirm it; see if it is compatible
      with beliefs (confirmatory bias of System 1). --> positive test strategy
  Exaggerated emotional coherence (halo effect):
    Tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person including
    things not witnessed.
    Halo effect increases weight of first impressions.
    Grading bias of 2 essay questions: grade of first biased second;
      correcting grade #1 in all then #2: less happy & confident with grading.
    Reduce halo effect: de-correlate error; get separate testimony of witnesses,
      CO executes write their position before a meeting.
  What you see is all there is (WSIATI):
    --> coherence (SYS 1) & cognitive ease (SYS 2)to accept statement;
    consistency matters more than  completeness;
    people seeing one-sided evidence more confident of decision than seeing both
    --> 1. overconfidence; story quality instead of evidence quantity/quality
        2. framing effects: 90% fat free better than 10% fat
        3. statistical neglect: think meek person as librarian not a farmer

8. How judgments happens
   System 2: infinite questions/answers form own thoughts or outside.
             may trigger basic assessments
   System 1: a. Basic assessments - continuous inside/outside mind; without intention  or effort
                substituted for difficult questions - heuristics/biases
             b. translate values across dimensions
             c. mental shotgun
   Basic assessment:
     shaped by evolution for survival
     good/bad; good mood/cognitive ease --> safe/familiar
     Friend/enemy: judge stranger: 1. dominance (square chin = threat)
                                   2. trust (smile = good intentions)
     Politician pictures rated in competence & likability:
       Facial competence (strength & trust) rating same as election results
       Competence rating of TV watchers (info poor) = 3x normal
     System 1 good/bad for average/sum
       neglects quantity in emotional context
   Intensity matching:
     Intensity/amount dimension(more/less): happiness, popularity, criminal punishment
     System 1 matches intensity in diverse dimensions;
       Man's height analogous to child reading at 1.5 years: 7'8'';
       statistically wrong; System 2 acceptable
   Mental shotgun:
     we compute more than we want/need.
     Finding if word sounds rhyme is slower if words are shown


9. Answering an easier question
   Normal state of mind: intuitive feelings & opinions about everything
   Substituting questions
     via mental shotgun & intensity matching
     if answer to hard question not found, system 1 find a simpler heuristic question
       Heuristic: procedure to find adequate/imperfect answer to hard questions
     How happy are with your life? --> What is your mood right now?
     Lazy system 2 accepts heuristic answer;
       you may not realize that question was difficult
   3-D heuristic
     2-D figures in drawing with vanishing point are substituted with 3-D --> illusion
   Mood heuristic for happiness
     Experiment:
       How happy are you these days?
       How many dates did you have this month?
         Correlation of the 2 answers was zero;
         Reversing order of questions --> high correlation; similar to 2-D illusion
       Any emotional question that changes mood has same effect
   Affect heuristic
     persons like/dislikes determine their beliefs about the world
       think costs are low and benefits are high
     system 2 is endorser of system 1; it searches for information consistent
       with current beliefs

  System 1 characteristics:
    Impression, feeling, inclination via System 2 --> belief, attitude, intention
    Operates quickly WO effort or control
    Can be directed by System 2 to pay attention
    With training--> skilled intuition/response
    Creates coherent pattern of ideas in associative memory
    Links cognitive ease and illusion of truth / pleasant feelings / reduced vigilance
    Differentiates surprise/normal
    Infers/invents cause & intention
    Neglects ambiguity & suppresses doubt
    Biased to believe & confirm
    Exaggerates emotional consistency (halo [or non] halo effect)
    Focuses/neglects existing/absent evidence; What you see is all there is (WSIATI)
    Creates limited set of basic assessments
    Represents sets by norms/stereotypes
    Match intensities across scales - color to loudness
    Computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
    Substitutes hard question with an easier (heuristic) one
    More sensitive to change than state
    Over-weights small probabilities
    Less sensitive to quantity
    Responds stronger to loss than gain
    Isolates corpusdecision problems

_________________________PART 2 HEURISTICS AND BIASES___________________________

10. Small number law
  System 2 (search)/system 1 (associative) hypothesis for:
      "Cancer rate is lowest in rural / republican counties"
        --> clean living not republican
      "Highest cancer rate is in rural / republican counties"
        --> poverty/healthcare not republican
         both cannot be true;
           rural/republican irrelevant; small population size is relevant;
           have a statistics not an epidemiology problem
  Random event has no cause
    Sets of random events have pattern;
    Coin tosses HHTT = 6x likely as HHHH or TTTT
      Getting HHHH (4) = 8x likely as HHHHHHH (7)
      For heads assign cancer cancer to each person
         --> extreme cancer rates in small counties; nothing to explain
             ---> small sampling size artifact
        You knew, but not well enough, that large samples are more precise!
  Small number law:
     law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well.
     Psychology research: sample size is risk and nuisance;
       common to have small size with 50% chance to reproduce results
         reflects intuitive misconceptions
       statistics textbook authors made same mistakes
  Bias of confidence over doubt
    "A poll of 300 seniors - 60% support president": 60% gets attention not 300
       eager for the story not source of story
    small number law: bias for certainty over doubt;
      exaggerate consistency and coherence of what we see
    cause and chance
      what is more likely HHHHH HHTHTT? - both same but HHTHTT looks more random
      Bombing of London did not appear random - tended to cluster...
      Basketball hot hand: cognitive illusion of players/fans/coaches
      In 1,655 schools 6 of the top 50 were small
        --> foundations & government wasted money on small school programs;
            did not know that worst schools had same chance.
   Stories behind small number law:
     1. see only message instead of info (reliability) about message;
        prefer simpler/coherent world view
     2. wrong causal explanation of random (statistical) events

11. Anchors (numbers)
  Anchor effect: consider particular value of unknown before estimating it.
    price willing to pay effected by asking price
    Any number asked to consider triggers the the anchor effect
  Anchoring as adjustment
    start from anchor, then adjust - typically premature because of mental depletion
  Anchoring as priming effect
    suggestion & anchoring --> System 1 associative coherence
  Anchor index
     "is height of redwood less than 1,200 feet" "what is its height?"
       1,200 --> 180; guess 844 --> 282 ; (844-282)/(1,200-180) = 55%
     Real estate agents/business students effected by listing price 41%/48%
     Environmentalists for no-anchor/$5/$400 contribution, gave 64/20/143
       (143-20)/(400-5) = 30%
     Random anchors as effective as informative anchors because people cannot
       distinguish between the two.
     Judges rolled loaded dice with 4/9, asked if sentence would be less or more
       they sentenced 5/8 months; 50% anchoring
  Uses and abuses of anchors
    priming or insufficient adjustment --> gullibility
    Marketing ploy: rationing; 12 limit --> for people to buy more
    House seller makes fist move with listing price
    Capping lawsuit wards helps large companies/offenders
    Think the opposite to counter anchor effects
  Thought behavior influenced by unaware stimuli (priming effect)
  Aware of anchor but unaware how its effects; "how free are you?"
