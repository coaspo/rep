1. Glioblastoma
  Primary brain tumor - starts and stays in brain
    Glioblastoma multiforme/High-grade glioma (GBM/HGG; grades 4/3)
    GBM/HGG same treatment, HGG (anaplastic cancer?) is less aggressive
    Glioma types:
      1. astrocytoma - resembles astrocytes - most aggressive
      2. oligodendroglioma - resembles oligodendrocytes (low grade - slow)
    Grade 3 - anaplastic astrocytoma
            - anaplastic  oligodendroglioma
    Grade 4 - glioblastoma

    Symptoms:
      1. headache (worse in morning)
      2. seizure (low grade glioma)
      3. fatigue
      4. nausea/vomit from pressure in brain
      5. thinking/speech problems
      6. weakness/balance
      7. sensory - numbness/tingling/burning in hands/feet
      8. mood/personality change
      9. vision - blurred, peripheral
      10. blood clots in legs (deep vein) & lungs (pulmonary embolism)
  Brain areas:
    1. Frontal lobe (11:00-2:30)
      behavior/problem/personality/movement/memory/smell
    2. parietal lob (pariet- â€˜wallâ€™; 10:00-11:30)
      language/reading/sensation
    3. Occipital lobe (8:00-10:00)
      vision/color
    3. temporal lobe (time; 8:00-10:00) ear borders 1/2/3
      hearing/speech/vision/memory/emotion
    4. cerebellum (little cerebrum[brain]) base
      balance, coordination

  Brain 4 cell types: 1. neurons, 2. ependymal cells
    3. blood vessel cells, 4. glial
  Molecular test: biomarkers - evolving how useful they are
    Play gold long enough will get "hole in one" - of get a long term GBM survivor

2. Oncology team:
  1. Neurosurgeon
  2. Neuro-oncologist - chemo, immuno therapies
  3. Radiation oncologist
  4. Neuro-adiologist: read MRI, CT,  nuclear imaging scans
  5. Neuro-pathologist: find if GBM, or HGG - handful in country
  6. Registered (or navigation) nurse: pass info to doctors
  others:
    dietitian - stay healthy,
    genetic counselor - GBM genetic profile - GBM not inheritable
    patient advocate/navigator - volunteer - possibly cancer survivor
    financial counselors - navigate insurance
    family - take notes / emotional support

3. Imaging tests
  CT - to check for brain bleeding, swelling, injury
  MRI - get swelling details; infection, multiple sclerosis
    Only biopsy identifies GBM/HGG
    Taken every 8 - 16 weeks - check treatment & new growth
    Contrast MRI: gadolinium/chelating agent
      in 24 hours >
      90% passed by kidneys
      1% retained in bone/brain
      may cause Nephrogenic (kidney) systemic fibrosis
      solid & edges of GBM light up
        Pseudo-progression:
          scar tissue from surgery/radiation also lights up
    Measure tumor growth:
      MRS - magnetic resonance spectroscopy - GBM chemical signature
      MRP - magnetic resonance perfusion - measure blood flow; GBM has more,
        radiation treated GBM has less
    fMRI - functional MRI - patient asked to speak, tap toes/fingers...
      used to plan surgery

4. Cookbook
  All cancer centers use NCCN cookbook (National Comprehensive Cancer Network)
    nccn.org  View 2021 PDF: >Guidelines >Guidelines-for-patients >Brain-cancer
      (May reach end of NCCN approved recommendations)
  Karnofsky performance scale 0 --> 100
    60 (be able to walk, bathe, cook) is the cutoff for using NCCN guidelines

5. Surgery
  Craniotomy (gross total resection) size of cookie - remove as much as possible
    1. relieve neurological symptoms
    2. best way to treat tumor
    Biopsy only if tumor is in critical area - for example in thalamus
  Stereotactically surgery:
    MRI image / computer guided surgery
  Intra-operative MRI:
    MRI scanning during surgery; can remove more of the tumor
    (controversial of how much more)
  Fluorescence
    Drink Gleolan (5-aminolevulinic acid [5-ALA]) 6 hours before surgery
    tumor glows pink - more tumor removed; unknown if it increases longevity
  Awake craniotomy
    test speech/motor functions during surgery
    not all surgeons/anesthesiologists comfortable with this
  Surgery: 30 min to 15 hours
  After surgery: acetaminophen or mild narcotic
    no driving, every day is a Sunday

6. Chemotherapy
  Most medication that kill cancrs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier
  Temozolomide (TMZ) (Temodar) cytotoxic; alters tumors DNA, since 2005
    1 pill/day for 4 to 6 weeks with radiation therapy
    after radiation,  1 pill/day for 5 days every 28 days
    if doing well continue for a year
    Side effects: nausea, vomiting, low blood cell count
      rare : appetite loss, constipation....
  Bevacizumab (Avastin) stops cancer from creating blood vessels - starve cancer
    second line - after Temozolomide is not working
    IV every 2 weeks
    side effects: bloddy nose, headache, hypertension
  Lomustine(CCNU) cytotoxic
    oral, 6 to 8 week intervals
    effective if tumor has methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
    Epigenetic silencing of MGMT gene by methylation decreases an enzyme
    which may compromise DNA repair
    Side effects: nausea, vomiting - controlled by other medications
                  decrease of white blood cells - blood counts closely monitored
  Bevacizumab Lomustine alone or separate increase progression-free survival
    (live with the disease but not get worse)
    they do not increase in overall length of survival
  KL-50 - cytotoxic solves TMZ resistance
  Carmustine (BICNU) - nickel size wafer
    dissolves slowly, true benefit not known

  Genetic markers
    1. Methylation- methyl group added to cytosine (DNA)
        epigenetic mechqnism; repairs DNA, switches gene on/off
        helps detoxification
        helped by methylation diet:
          eggs, vegetables, avocado, garlic, fish, eggs, beans
        methyls from from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from folate, methionine, betaine, and vitamin B12
        Over-methylation: low mood
      Brain tumor has methylated MGMT promoter gene
        MGMT DNA repair enzyme: MGMT: O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)
           silences genes which cause toxicity
           removes the guanine-alkyl group induced by alkylating agents
           antagonizes the genotoxic effects of alkylating (chemo drugs)agents
      MGMT gene:
        encodes DNA damage repair protein that removes alkylating agents;
        results to resistance to chemotherapy (temozolomide)
        temozolomide: becomes potent methylating agent stops DNA replication


Ketogenic diet
  3:1 or 4:1 of fats:non-fats - oil, butter...
  Better: Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) diet - coconut/palm oil
    lesser: milk, nuts, avodados, fish, meat
