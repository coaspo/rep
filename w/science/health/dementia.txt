10% of 65+ have dementia
50% of 95+

dementia starts with cognitive/behavioral then physically
   terminal; not treatable
   B12 deficiency is pseudo dementia because it is treatable
   incurable, shortens life span
   global effects, not just memory/reasoning
   live about 5 years after diagnosis
      Alzheimer's 20, Creutzfeldt-Jacob 6 monhts

central nervous system (CNS):
   brain,
   spinal cord
peripheral nervous system (PNS)
   nerves/two-way streets to CNS from body, and from the CNS to muscles/organs/glands.

Neuron
  tennis ball (cell) with 10 km hose (axon; wire)
  actual axon length <= 1.5 m
  dendrites
    receivers
    short like root of tree
    connect to other nerves
  axon terminals
     one or more at end of axon
  synapse:
    communication point; dendrite, tiny gap, terminal
    electricity in axon
     --> neurotransmitter in gap binds to a dendrite receptor
     --> electricity in dendrite
     --> nerve cell activity
     memories may be encoded by modification of synaptic strength

Muscle action: minimum of 2 neurons:
  brain to spinal
  spinal to muscle

Neuro-plasticity:
    adaptability of new activity to change & develop synapses
    taxi drives have larger than average hippocampus(memory)
  Building up connections creates 'cognitive reserve'
    which may reduce dementia risk
  forms of plasticity (learning):
    long-term potentiation (LTP) - active synapses --> stronger
        ''    depression (LTD) - inactive    ''    --> weaker
  functional: move function of damaged area to other area
  structural: make physical changes

neurotransmitter
  Glutamate:
    excitatory (turn on) neurotransmitter (most abundant in brain)
    anionic of Glutamic acid
      Glutamic acid in cheese & soy sauce --> umami  (MSG)
        1.5 million tons/year via aerobic fermentation of sugars and ammonia
        in meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products
        is 1/3 of gluten
    made by nerve cell, stored in thin-walled vesicles (synaptic vesicles) at the axon terminal
    can bind to 4 diffrent receptors
    90% of all excitatory functions in brain
    (most abundant amino acid in the body)
    memory, cognition, and mood regulation
    glial cells:
       convert “used” glutamate to glutamine, which is converted back again into glutamate
    glioblastoma uses glutamate as an energy source
    Deficits in orientation (time, place, and person) --> brain disease
      normal aging may have mild loss of orientation
  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA):
    turn off neurotransmitter
    controls hyperactivity of anxiety, stress and fear, improve sleep
    inhibits neuron of receiving/creating/sending chemical messages
    made from glutamate
    in food; may not cross blood-brain barrier
    may treat blood pressure, insomnia
  Glycine:
    turn off neurotransmitter
    amino acid in food, most in pork skins, meat
    made in the body
      decreases with age
    also called Aminoacetic acid, glycol
    antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cryoprotective, immunomodulatory in peripheral and nervous tissues
    component of creatine - a muscle energy/size source
    1/3 to 1/4 of collagen (the most abundant protein)
      collagen supplements for skin firmness/wrinkles not proven!
      wrinkles: low collagen
    stimulate serotonin (feel good) hormone
    supplements may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
    inversely related with obesity
    present in space
  adrenaline
    aka Epinephrine
    both a neurotransmitter & hormone (main role)
    release by adrenal glands
    transmits msg across muscle/gland/neuron cells
    sympathetic nervous system - fight/flight
  Dopamine
    made in brain
      both a neurotransmitter & hormone (vasodialator)
    feel-good; love drug
      released during orgasm
    decreased in Parkison's
    made from tyrosine (amino acid)
      tyrosine supplements may improve cognition
  Acetylcholine
    learning, attention, arousal and involuntary muscle movement
    in neuromuscular junction
    main in parasympathetic (automatic) nervous system
    decreased in Alzheimer's

Brain
  1. Cerebral cortex ; outer layer of cerebrum
      outer wrinkly brain - thoughts/feeling/personality
      has plasticity - modify connections
      Lobes
        1. frontal
             personality/decision
        2. parietal (wall)
             middle top
             receive/process sensory:
               pain, touch,heat, cold, body awareness
        3. temporal (where white hair appears)
             middle sides
             has hippocampus inside
               new memories
               ships memories for long term storage
               when we sleep or dream
        4. occipital (head)
             rear
             sight - color, form, motion
  2. Cerebelum
      rear below cerebrum
      muscle control; balance/ movement
      language processing and memory
  3. Stem
      1. Midbrain on top: eye movements
      2. Pons on middle: facial movements, hearing and balance.
      3. Medulla one bottom: breathing, heart rhythms, blood pressure and swallowing.

Causes of Dementia (may overlap)
  Definitive diagnosis via biopsy
  1. Alzheimer's disease == disconnection (parts of brain) syndrome
       60-70% of all older people dementia
       1. insidious onset - difficult first symptoms
       2. progressive degenerative condition - worse over time
          faster or slower
             (same for Frontotemporal & Lewy body)
       3. specific pathologies (hall marks)
          cannot form new memories
            ''   plan or think logically -executive function
            ''   speak
            ''   orient in space/time
          personality changes - introvert to extrovert & vice versa
          confusion
        Temporal lobe/hippocampus (memory) atrophies 1st
          then lobe (intelligence), parietal (language), occipital (sight)
        Brain regions disconnect from each other
        Physical changes cerebral cortex
          1. beta-amyloid (normal protein) plaques (discovered 100 years ago);
               beta-amyloid forms (abnormal) filaments
               then plaques
             plaques not sufficinet for Alzheimer's; need (2)
             axons in plaques are swollen (dystrophic neurites)
          2. neurofibrillary tangle.
               inside neurons made up of hyperphosphorylated tau protein
               kills neurons
  2. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
       under 65 age ; can effect teenagers - agitated, self center, eating continuously
       several diseases (different clumps of proteins in neurons)
         atrophy in frontal (most advanced) and temporal
       1. behavior (frontal) - change of personality
          impaired judgment & planning
          apathy, no motivation, no empathy, dis-inhibition
          diet; eat more, prefer sweets
       2. language (temporal); primary progressive aphasia (lack of speech)
          cannot understand/produce speech

      Most common aggregate proteins:
        1. Tau; same as in Alzheimer's, but different shape
        2. TDP-43; controls genetic material
           also in motor neuron disease;
             people with frontotemporal may develop "motor neuron"" and vice versa
      Aggregates inside neuron supporting glial cells:
         oligodendrocyte: form myelin sheath around axon
         astrocytes: nurishment, repair (20-40% or all glia) - start of glioblastoma
  3. Lewy body disease
       faster than Alzheimer's - 5 year instead of 20 year survival
       trouble planning
       hallucinations (cannot use psychotic drugs)
       mistaken for Parkinsons, also cognitive similar to Alzheimer's
       Robin Williams had it
       Lewy bodies are clumps of alpha-synuclein proteins
          alpha-synuclein in heart,nerves, & muscles
       invalid folding of alpha-synuclein causes clumps
       In Parkinson's Lewy bodies form in sustantia nigra (produces dopamine)
         dopamine is feel good & production of smooth movement
  4. Vascular dementia
       planning, solving problems
       stokes; hardening of arteries; atherosclerosis
       step-wise decline


Non-dementia:
  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI):
     smaller hypothalamus, with normal cortex

Possible dementia:
  1. Korsakoff syndrome
    B-1 (Thiamine) deficiency, from alcohol abuse
    short and long term memory problem; thinking social skills intact
    make up or confabulate information (they believe it)
    audio/visual hallucinations
    25% recover, 25% stay same, 50% get worsee
  2. AIDS dementia
      HIV infection in the brain
      50% recovery rate


Risks for dementia
  1. non-modifiable:
     aging & genetics
      apolipoprotein E4 gene: inked to late-onset (over 65) Alzheimer's disease
        one APOE e4 dubles risk
      early-onset 5% Down syndrome higher risk, strongly genetic
  2.potentially modifiable
      may reduce our risk of dementia, or delay symptoms


dementia
  not a normal part of aging
  by clinical symptoms
    1. 1 or more progressive cognitive declines memory or language
       + behavior/personality changes
    2. more cognitive decline; speech
    2. not due top depression (looks like dementia)
       or delirium (quick medical condition; confusion, hallucination; treatable)
  Normal aging
    cognitive decline;  mirrors physical function
    cross-sectional studies (more common):
       memory versus age of different people
       difference maybe due to education
       decline starts around 30
    longitudinal study (more powerfull)
       same person for 10,20,30 years
       20-30 language improves, then declines
       reaction speed declines after 25 year
       get slower but improve language
       60 expertise does not compensate by experience

    At 70 have more info than at 20.
    Clinical symptoms
      drop of memory seen in less than 20% in age group
      memory less than 10th percentile (90% are better)
         more likely 2nd percentile(98% are better)
      daily living; cook toilet
        early stages is the complex behavior
    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      small, but not clinical, cognitive decrease
      10-40% of MCI will get dementia
        versus 1-2% of normal aging will get dementia
      20-40% will improve
      like smoking - do  not always get cancer
      is not diagnosis - is a risk factor
      hormonal imbalance or depression may look like dementia..

Cognitive reserves
  higher education delays Alzheimer's - more pathology before symptoms
  higher intelligence delays clinical signs - once they do decline is faster
  Teachers 3.5x likely with speech/language disorder than Alzheimer's disease
  sales and retail, nursing, care assistants, crop farmers and livestock producers
    15% higher chance of developing dementia
  education, occupation, leisure,

Brain reserve
  education, occupation, leisure, exercise, socializing, diet
  education for job and brain reserve

Dementia Domains
   1. Cognition: Short term memory, time, orientation, reasoning; Alzheimer's
   2. psychiatric: delusions/hallucinations
        distorted thinking causing distress;
         Lewy body: delusions first symptoms
               distress & larger impact with family
         70% Alzheimer's have psychiatric
         --> avoid "bad/cranky" person label
         critical for families to understand this
      Depression symptoms
         inert, withdrawn --> formalize social activities
   3. behavior: personality changes; Alzheimer's
   4. function
   5. physical/mobility; Huntigton's - mobility in early
   Dementia is global; effects various functions
     various consequences/interventions
   Symptoms fluctuate from day to day
   Change of personality is hard for families to adjust
   Understanding makes it easier for caretakers
   Front temporal dementia - personality/behavior change - memory/mobility intact

   Behavior domain: say inappropriate things, bad finance decisions
   Dysfunction variation in all domains; intensity/consequence
   Vary from person to person and dementia type

   Dementia progression: more dysfunction in all domains;
     personality(are), behavior(do), mobility, cognitive, psychiatric
   common late dysfunction: mobility/swallowing
   Domain awareness: dementia is about all functions

Diagnosis
  1. history of person
  2. speaking to family, carers, neighbors
  3. how things changed; corroborative history
  4. tests memory, judgment, mini mental status exam (MMSE);
       A. orientation, memory, and attention
       B. verbal, written abilities
  5. physical - lungs are OK, no infection for recent changes (dementia is not fast)
  6. neurological; CT/MRI of brain - vascular changes
  7. basic/routine investigations:
      thyroid (pseudo dementia)
      B12 (blood cell formation, nerve function)
        eggs
      folate (B9/lack of energy), high folate may mask B12 deficiency; prevent dementia
        eggs, beans, citrus
      thiamine (B1 fatigue, tingling arms/legs) WO B1: nerve damage and/or death
        orange. peanuts
      enriched bread: (folic acid, thiamine, niacin[B3], riboflavin[B2])
   With mild dementia, infection more easily causes delirium
   Rare: Posterior Cortical Atrophy, or PCA: atypical Alzheimer’s (5-15%)
      trouble interpreting information they see
   Dementia: clinical diagnosis; history; change over time
             not one test; no one size fits all
             corroborative history from family confirm diagnosis
             cognitive tests
             brain scan for some
             physical exam; eliminate delirium
             more susceptible to delirium
             difficult to diagnose type of dementia;
               but this is not significant for care & treatment

   From patronizing to upfront - be in control; do not hide diagnosis
   Information given depends on dementia & if family is included - give reference
   general practitioner: time limited & symptom focused; see infection but
                           not the deteriorating self care
                         not comfortable diagnosing dementia
   Diagnosis disclosure: depends on circumstance
                         recognize person deficits and healthy areas

Early (or younger) onset dementia
   under 65;  1/10k people; 5-10% of all dementia
   Alzheimer's most prevalent
     fronto-temporal second most common
   rise of alcohol/drugs related dementia
     could be (???) because of better profiling/awareness
   3 years to get diagnosis
   misdiagnosed as depression/anxiety; dementia may be causing depression
   complex social and psychological impact than with older people
   big impact on families
   focused support to sustain social connections

  memory problems not always dementia, but from problems of:
    depression/anxiety/stress
    medication side effects
    sleep
    eyesight or hearing
    infections: chest
                urinary tract
    constipation
    thyroid
    iron/vitamins

Stages of dementia
   Divide disease to understand it
   infancy, childhood, teens, adult, (second childhood for some), (old and foolish for some)
   stage 1 - mild
     cognition (thinking) effected; memory, judgment, planning, mood (shorter fuse -irritable)
     might seek diagnosis
   stage 2 - cognitive
     more memory, behavior, psychiatry,
     perception awareness of danger impaired
     lost when taking a walk & no insight to ask for direction
     physical able but need support
     loss of inhibition
   stage 3 - physical; advance
     loss of nerve impulses
     mobility, function; eat, swallow, dress
     incontinence
     chew/swallow
     infections from lack of mobility

Medical management
    cholinesterase: enzyme for acetylcholine --> choline & acetic acid
                    allows neuron to return to resting state,
                    prevents excessive muscle contraction
    cholinesterase(AChE) inhibitors; benefits 3 out 10 delays disease by 6 months
      donepezil (Aricept®) - treat all stages; most common
      rivastigmine(Exelon®); also blocks butyrylcholinesterase,
         used if donepezil has side effects
      galantamine: tertiary alkaloid in nature, may cause seizures
      memantine: blocks effects of glutamate
        glutamate sends message between neurons, can cause more damage
        too much in Alzheimers & too little in old patients
        glutamate sticks to receptors allowing calcium into nerve cell & damaging it
    Alzheimer's: depletion of acetylcholine neurotransmitter
    acetylcholine enhancers reduce breakdown of acetylcholine
      small benefit: 6 month improvement of trajectory
                     do not reduce nursing home start time
    sinemet
      for parkinsons
      levodopa and carbidopa
         Levodopa converted to dopamine in the brain
         carbidopa increases dopamine
           dopamine gives pleasure controls, memory, mood, sleep, learning
    medication making dementia worse:
      (opposite of  cholinesterase inhibitors;
       deplete acetylcholine)
      opiates
      tramadol; forSafety considerations in Stage 2 of dementia  severe pain
      anti-cholinergic effect
        cogentin (used for Parkinsons) for movement symptoms
   non-medical treatements
     change environment to avoid interpenetration & keep people calm
   anti-psychotics
     for dementia symptoms like aggression
     modest benefits with a lot of side effects; mostly avoided
     have many side effects; use small doses (1/2 mg)
     Risperidone(1/2 mg) for schizophrenia; calming - makes you dizzy
     Olanzapine for schizophrenia - large sedative & addictive; makes you sleepy
     Haloperidol for schizophrenia hallucinations, blocks dopamine receptors
     quetiapine for schizophrenia
     aripiprazole for schizophrenia, makes you sleepy & difficult to sleep
       all anti-cholinesterasepsychotics may benefits other people not the patient
       discuss with next of kin
     behavioral:
       someone complaining of rain
       find out why (to pick up kids, now grown, from school)
       tell them that parents will pick them up

   Temazepam for insomnia; increases  gamma-aminobutyric acid
     effect mobility
     increases fall risk for Alzheimer's
   Non-pill
     end-of-life:
       physical touch
       music exposure
       interaction of pets
       family visits

    futile treatments
      cancer treatment
      cholesterol medicine
      pneumonia treatment for the end of life
    Goal of peaceful/calm death
      check environment, agitation, anxiety
logic--> emotion --> spirit
TV is a sensory assault

Insidious onset
  Prevent/hide diagnosis: family denial, bereavement, reluctant MD (futility of diagnosis),
                          non-qualified MD, MD not knowing memory clinics

Common:
  worry missing early diagnosis
  fear of future
  sibling conflict for care

Many care options, important before onset of heavy symptoms
   home care, respite care (give care takers a break)
   palliative (cloak symptoms) care; includes bereavement

Personal accounts
  People saying to dementia patient that they forget is hurtful
  I have dementia and may say hurtful things
  Need  spirit-to-spirit communication
  Others can help reconstruct memories; create a word picture
  hanging onto a high cliff, above a lurking black hole
  May interpret thing different than other
      have periods of confusion & lucidity
      sometimes not recognize people well
      frustrated with people struggling to understand them
      not able to communicate fear/anxiety
  Live with unpredictability & surprised with time
  Emotions are intact - laugh & cry about same things

Carer accounts
  physical, psychological, financial, social and emotional demands
  Clock test: could draw only  half the numbers
  Questioned diagnosis because of moments of clarity
  Outsides add to problem because they do not see any problem
  (dementia patients retain social skills)
  Outsiders do not see the small things;
    used to make tea, but now does not know where are the cups
    standing still not knowing why
    one black/brown shoe
  Eternal vigilance is exhausting; not abnormal for both
  Cannot have patience all the time
  Loss of companion; looks the same but is not the same (annoyance)
  annoyed on having to take up role of companion
  I did not sign up for this
  there is not manual for the job
  society expects to do job, but
   stress and anxiety tests the limit of what it is to be human
  Sundowner; OK during the day but after 4:00 some things not OK
  Support group: affinity & sense of relief for "I just want to scream"
                 understand 'how it really is'
  Respite (daycare; carer rests from unpleasant) keeps me sane
  Paradoxes what is lost & retained 'nothing nice, partner is a stranger,
     still fascinated by changes'
  Having insight into his condition (caring ans sorry) rapidly changes
    into 'awful strange person'
  Accepted that I do not do a good job (being human)- if I could resign I would.
  Do like lying, but do whatever works - not for managing but for surviving;

Dementia and behaviors
  Changes of behavior: BPSD - behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
   'challenging', 'problem', 'difficult', and 'concerning' is for others
    not the patient
  Behavior is not about changes in the brain -
    may not be able to ask for something but will become upset on not being able.
  Wondering could be something that a person enjoys
  or maybe is aimless if one just starts walking
    it could be medicine side effect, away to alliviate pain or constipation
    or the brain changes
  Problems need exploration.
  Behavior from pathology versus controllable external factors
  Walking can be normal not wondering
  Can all behavior problematic after knowing its impact

  Anxiety - unease, dread,
    being less capable can cause anxiety
    find cause, need to know history
    with dementia hard navigation can cause anxiety
      do not expect person to do things
    tradionally looked at medical solutions instead of looking fro causes
    see are they happy nervous...
    easier to scape goat dementia than finding other factors
    Aggression verbal/physical
      know the person and look for a cause;
        frustration, pain when dressing them
        need to know what hurts - reaction can be violence
      very rare that a peaceful person becomes violent with dementia
    Interaction of dementia with environment
      dementia changes behavior but other factor do it
    Withdrawl - other side, causes:
      depression - treatable
      having an environment that you can go to
      dementia causes apathy
      opportunities to be involved
   Anxiety common to dementia and non-dementia
     source can be ability loss, or stressful environment
   Pain may trigger violence
   Apathy is over looked
     maybe medical & treatable
     helpful to initiate activities

   Resistance to care
     people loose insight
     reminding people they are not capable --> argument & upsetting
     be highly aware what is upsetting
     know the person and what works for them
     for anger genuine apology or taking blame works very well
     not adversarial but being human
     avoid arguments & validating persons feelings
     be mindful and control body language (say disgust by incontinence)
        facial expressions, tone of voice
   Sun-downing late afternoon or evening restlessness
      could be light, did not go outside
   any sudden change could be delirium, infection

   Resistance to care
     due to lack of dignity comfort
   Avoiding arguments
     apologizing can be very effective
   Sun-downing can be modified
   Sudden changes should be investigated

   Can not attribute all to dementia
     have to see our behavior
       infantilizing (talk as if talking to a baby) is very upsetting
       adult to adult with simple clear language - give me x instead of give me that
       do not ask more than ones abilities
   Be mindful that people with dementia still have preferences
     reminding mistakes creates humiliatinp
   Be mindful of body language
     example being disgusted of exasperated by incontinence
   Think of who people are as human beings.
   I they have dementia, make their life as easy as possible.

   Recognize our role and know how to modify our behavior to be helpful.
   Clear concise non-patronizing communication
   Recognize strenght & limitation of patients and engage
   Focusing on mistakes/losses is unproctive

Pain and dementia
  MRI scans show pain brain activity is same in dementia patients - ethics workaround?
  pain types:
    psychological (distress from dementia) /
    physical pain (independent of dementia)
    Observe pain during or after movement
  Abbey Pain Scale - during movement
       Absent (0)   Mild (1)   Moderate (2)   Severe (3)
    1. Vocalisation
       eg: whimpering, groaning, crying
    2. ----Facial Expression----
       eg: looking tense, frowning, grimacing, looking frightened.
    3. ----Body Language---
       eg: fidgeting, rocking, guarding part of body, withdrawn
    4. Behavioural Change.
       eg: increased confusion, refusing to eat, alteration in usual patterns.

         4. lack of education/motivation -
             GPs educated be specialized nurses
         5. dementia difficulty - not it might be pain
       need better management,
         Last dose syndrome
           people hesitant to use morphine...

    People with dementia get less analgesia
      due to 1. myth that those people do not feed pain
             2. difficult to tell distress from pain
             3. lack of skills or education
             4. seeing dementia as the problem than the pain
             5. fear of using analgesics
