Sitting the new smoking
50% have diabetes or pre-diabetes;
  have insulin resistance for years/decades before pre-diabetes diagnose
  16% of normal weight are insulin resistant
  elevated insulin makes hungry - insulin is fat storage hormone
  rice -->  insulin/glucose spike, hunger, fat storage, cravings CYCLE
type 2 diabetes is carb toxicity
  have essential protein fats but no carb - min daily carb can be zero
  insulin resistance 42% of heart attacks
  gluconeogenesis - liver produce glucose
    metformin block gluconeogenesis
  low carb intervention reduces hundreds of insulin units in days/weeks
    cures type-2diabetis
    not zero crabs, not high protein --> high fat
    reduces inflammatory markers - hence cancer
    patients reduced insulin ~500units/day, high card increased by 300
    rules:
      no low fat anything
      no natural food, or in a box
      do not anything you do not like
      no GPS - grains, potatoes, sugars
        coconut flower muffin, almond, hazel, flax flowers, saute mushrooms
   cause of not doing low carb diet:
     1. status quo - invalid fat study
     2. money in making you sick
    do not use medicine to treat food illness
low fat diet:
  sugar industry funded 1967 Harvard JAMA review article comparing
  (cherry picking) low fat and sugar
Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food - Hippocrates

Coronary artery disease
  prevents plaues?
  1940's Framingham heart study
    1. modifiable
       high LDL - in damage vessels
       high triglycerides - indirectly increase LDL
       hypertension - sheer stress damage to vessel wall
       BIGGEST - cigarette smoking
         toxins damage vessel walls, damage --> plaque
       BIG - diabetes - excess glucose damages blood vessels - glycosylation
        damage --> plaque
       lack of exercise
       cocaine - vasospasm- simulates plaque
    2. non-modifiable risk
       1. age men/women after 45/55 - chronic plaque build-up
          men more cholesterol, women more estrogen, women listen more
       2. family history
       3. ethnicity - backs more risk

fragility fracture:
  reduced compressive/torsional bone strength, minimal or no trauma
  fall from standing height, hug, turning in bed, transfer to chair
   1. vertebrae (most common)
      2/3 silent --> poor posture, height loss (2 yr), pulmonary volume loss, protruding abdomen
      less balanced likely to break hip more mortality
   2. wrist or hip
  goal was to increase bone density
    now change strength, posture, stop losing bone
  Too fit to fracture:
    1. exercise
       not just walk --> multi exercise resistance/balance/aerobic
    2. movement - flexion/rotation/side-flexion
       aware how you move; in stead of no movement:
         avoid repeated, forceful, rapid, end-of range, combin og these

osteoporosis exercise
  1. strength  >= 2/week  legs arms  chest shoulders back weights/bands 8-12/each
  2. balance   ~20min/day  stand still: one leg, weight on toes heels, semi tandem
                           movements: tai chi -tandem walking, dance Progress
  3. aerobic   >= 5/week 30min/day  bouts >=10 min then go to 30 min
  4. posture/back extensor  5/10 day head press 3-5 sec hold
                                     Erector spinae activation in standing
  5. Spine Sparing Strategies during daily activity   “hip hinge” and “step to turn”
                       touch wall with butt swing a kettle weight

1000 mg of calcium 400 IU of vitamin D /day
2.5 hrs/week vigorous exercise
white beans
over 50 require 1,200 mg calcium
FRAX tool to find osteoporosis risk

1. 2-3 strength ex. 2x/week
2. 1 balance daily
3. aerobic 10 min
3. combined;
  20 min walk 5 mi tandem wall push ups, half squats arms extended
  during day raise heels waiting for microwave,  sit-to-stand arms folded during commercials
  be creative

First timers Fab 4:
 1. squats (knees behind toes), sit-to-stand, lunges(knee behind toes)
 2. heel  raises (hold counter top) hold 2-3 sec return slow, 2-3(10x) one foot
 3. wall  push ups - chest triceps - prevent fracture
 4. diagonal shoulder raises with exercise band

Spine sparing:
  hip hinge - hip -no spine - motion - check with hands
  lift and step to turn  and bend knees to lower - no twisting
  limit lifting from or lowering to floor
  slow controlled twist
  support trunk when flexing
  hold weight close to body - not overhead

don't do --> do (safely)
summary:
  strength >2x/week
  balance daily
  walking not enough - aerobic..
  posture back extensors daily
    (Longissimus, Iliocostalis, and Spinalis)
    knees to chest: lengthen lumber extensors
    cat stretch with pelvic tilt
  spine sparing, reduce spine loads
  how to move

  posture: pull shoulders back,
    imagine holding grapefruit with chin
            gold thread pulling on top of head
            pressing equally on heel, big to joint, rest of toes
  breathing
    use entire chest/difram, think of posture
  hip hinge
    hip is 6 in below waist
    put hand on hinge and bend
    hold pole - ensure head/back/but on pole
  sitting
    hold pole as previous
    do not lean on back
    perch posture - rotate 45 deg on chair, widen knees, press on foot triage
  lift/carry
    golfers reach lean on pole hinge on one leg lift other
    modified golfers reach -stride legs, with without pole, hinge...
  safe sweeping
    stride forward, hinge, no twist - movement in line, step back instead of twist
  sit to floor
    marriage proposal position, on knees, twist on hip lay on side slid arm up or dog position
    lie on belly
  getting up from ground
    laying on back, arm over head, roll with raised arm down, push on to hip
    on knees, reach on chair, marriage position, lift up
  put shoes on
    sit hip, hinge, back straight or bring foot on on other leg & tie shoe
  put shoes on - version 2
    put shoes on bench, hip hinge, minimum flexion
  theraband exercise
    straight posture - back touching wall, hold band palms up, shoulder width,
    right hand on hip, lift left, band is sash

  warm-up/cool-down in each session
  cancer fatigue: (80% of cancer patients)
    does not improve with sleep or rest
    tasks are daunting
    loss of desire for activities
    anxious, depressed. negative
    cannot focus
    --> low red blood cell count

Exercise and common sport injuries
  Injury risk factors
    intrinsic: age, gender, flexibility, previous injury, anatomy, skill
        muscle protects against injury
      modifiable intrinsic factors
    extrinsic: equipment, environment, human factor
    acute/chronic injuries: one-moment/repeated-loading
      sprain: ligaments (bone-bone connection); around joints
      strain: tendon/muscle
      fracture: bone disruption
      contusion: bruise
      effusion: swelling in a joint

    common sports injuries:
      knee - 3 joints (bend & straighten):
        tibiofemoral: tibia/femur (bottom/top) bones
        patellofemoral: patella/femur (kneecap/top)
        superior tibial/fibur: (bottom/small-bottom)bones
      1. ACL (abterior cruciate ligament; inside knee) tear
          basketball, soccer...; quick change in direction
          young/old athletes: surgery/brace
            strengthen other parts of knee
      2. patellofemoral pain syndrome - when increasing training
          cause: knee cap muscle imbalance

      shoulder
        humerus (arm bone)
        scapula (shoulder blade)
        clavicle (collar bone)
        4 rotator-cuff muscles - humerus/scapula muscles
      3. shoulder impingement - overhead sports
         pinching of rorator-cuff tendons
         cause: muscle imbalance & poor thoracic/spine posture
      4. shoulder dislocation - throwing
            humerus ball is outside joint soccet
            hospital treatment; surgery for chronic problem
      4. shoulder separation - fall/hit to shoulder
            collarbone/shoulder-blade ligaments disrupted;
              see bump - clavicle elevated at shoulder
            sling/therapy right away

      elbow - 3 joints  (humerus/)
        humero-ulnar: (upper/lower arm bones)
        radiohumeral: (lower-near-thumb/upper arm bones)
        superior radio-ulnar: (lower-near-thumb/lower-near-palm)
      5. lateral epicondylosis- tennis (or typing) elbow
        (overuse of elbow-wrist/finger extensors)
        cause: irritate/degrade or elbow extensor tendon
        change in equipment or technique
        can become chronic if not addressed
      ankle - tibia/fibula (major/minor lower leg bones) & libaments
      6. lateral ankle sprain (inversion sprain - roll foot to outside)
         ligament damage
      7. concussion - head/face/neck hit --> force to brain
         headaches, vision, memory...
         concussion recognition tool
         80%-90% resolved in few weeks

      Treatment; RICE
        Rest - rest/modify activity
        Ice - reduce inflammation - heat better for chronic injury
              for 1st 24-48 hours
        Compression - reduce inflammation - much more important than ice
        Elevate - drain inflammation of injury
        Physical therapy - most important

Exercise and Arthritis
 (Rheumatoid arthritis is autoimmune disorder,
   Infectious - bacteria/viral related
   metabolic (Gout) - uric acid crystals - metabolic; breakdown of purines [adenine and guanine])
  Osteoathritis (arth=joint, itis=inflamation), most common
    micro/macro damage --> maladaptive repair response
    --> molecular derangement, abnormal metabolism
    --> cartilage degrade, bone remodeling, osteophyte (bone spurs)
        cartilage has no no blood vessels or pain sensors
    --> loss of function
    cartilage: shock absorption (a wet sponge)
    effects mostly weight-bearing joints: knees, hip
   articular (joint) capsule: joint sac
   synovial membrane: lines capsule, produces fluid
   knees- bow out, hips, thumbs, fingers
   early signs:
    knee/hip joint hurts and may feel stiff in the morning,
    or when you have been sitting still for a period of time
    symptoms without visible change on x-ray and vice versa
    no known way of curing cartilage loss
  signs:
    swelling, deformation, tenderness,
    muscle shrinkage & warmth around joint
    loss of movement, strength, & stability, abnormal walking
  treatments:
    education (moving is better than standing),
      exercise (less pain, better heart),
      weight control (obesity breaks down cartlidge faster)
    drugs
    surgery
      in USA 10% get physiotherapy before surgery!
  exercise benefits:
    decreases: pain, medication, fatigue, stiffness, & doctor visits
    increases: strength, coordination
    group aquatic increases long-term adherence
  Physical therapy:
    type, dose (resistance, repetitions, hold length), frequency

       Progression
         no-weights
         gravity eliminated
         sitting
         standing
         resistance - weights/bands
         dynamic - Swiss ball, sports
     Exercise prescription considerations:
       stiffness
       pain
       inflammation
       fatigue
       soft tissue involvement
       joint involvement
       diabetes, hypertension, obesity...
       medication; bleeding- contact sports not good
     Shorter and more frequent instead of longer
       retrain brain not to link exercise and pain
     Rx for knee arthritis:
       land-based - resistance, walking, tai chi
       weight management
       strength training
       hydrotherapy - swimming, water aerobics
     European Rx for hip/knee arthritis:
       strengthen (sustained isometric)- quadriceps & proximal hip girdle
       aerobic
       adjunctive range of movement/stretching
         adjunctive treatments: mindfulness, wellness, and exercise
     British Rx:
       Type/level should match condition
     Canadian Rx:
       right mix of flex, strength, endurance
       for reduced pain, strong heart, good health
     American Rx:
       For knee hip OA: cardiovascular - resistance, water, land...
