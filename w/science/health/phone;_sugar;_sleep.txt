Sugar: The Bitter Truth</a> by Robert H. Lustig.          ðŸ—“ 2009

  Problem: epidemic of 6-month old obesity because of sugar/fructose.
  Started with Ancel Keys's faulty conclusion about fat.
  Caffeine(diuretic) and salt in coke makes you more thirsty.
  <b>Only liver can metabolize fructose (like alcohol it is poison-like)</b> -
  it generates uric acid & increase systolic blood pressure.
  If glycogen depleted, one needs fructose - applies only to athletes.
  Obese intervention:
    1. No sugar drinks - only water & milk.
    2. Carbs with fiber.
    3. wait 20 min between servings.
  Exercise not to burn calories, but to:
    1. improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity
    2. reduce stress/cortisol (stress==obesity)
    3. make TCA cycle run faster (release stored energy),
       <B>detoxify fructose</B> and improve insulin sensitivity.
  In nature fructose comes with fiber!  Fruit is OK.
  Eat fiber to:
    1. reduce carbohydrate absorption - fat or fart
    2. induce satiety
    3. prevent absorption of some fatty acids  which can suppress insulin
