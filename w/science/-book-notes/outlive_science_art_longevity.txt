Outlive - the science and art of longevity by Peter Attia MD  born 1978  Â© 2023

Intro
  Author has dream of catching falling eggs
  eggs are the pancreatic cancer surgery; book is about eliminating the egg source.

1. The long game - from fast to slow death
   Gods gave Tithonus eternal life but not eternal youth - body continued to decay
   fast death: risk behavior /infection; medicine is good at preventing
   slow death: 1.heart 2. cancer 3. neuro-degenerative 4. metabolic
   Longevity parts: 1. lifespan
                       health-span - free 0f disease
                    2. mental/physical function
   A1C test: hemoglobin A1C, HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin, or glycohemoglobin test.
     glucose level of past 3 months
     pre diabetes if 5.7% - 6.4%; < 140 mg/dL --> exercise & diet wrong
   good/bad chelestore is oversimplified/usele3ss
   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) - most common liver disease
   PROTEIN-critical for aging well
   Exercise: best longevity drug
   Emotional health: make longevity meaningful
   proactive instead preventative medicine

2. Medicine 3.0 - rethink medicine in age of chronic disease
   "first do no harm" - BS - handle risk - may do harm in helping
   Medicine 1.0: Hippocrates - observation and guesses
     walk for exercise, "food can have good or bad medicine"
     disease caused by nature not gods
     invalid notion of humors
   Medicine 2.0: germ theory  ~1850 - instead of bad air of miasma
     Pasteur, Lister, Koch
     Semmelweis: proposed germ theory, ridiculed, died in insane asylum
     1628: Francis Bacon father of empiricism - scientific theory
       inductive; from specific to general
       observe + form hypothesis (guess)
     eradicate smallpox & polio, HIV, AIDS(advanced HIV), hepatitis C virus
       contaminated blood (Humans is reservoir)
     Small change of Mortality rate -8 infectious disease(antibiotics) in last 100 years

3.   Medicine 3.0: prevent chronic disease
     not technology but mindset - health-span/quality of life
     Titanic on being warned of ice-field:"keep out; shut up"
     Hyperbolic Discounting: choose smaller/immediate over larger/later rewards
     Sun Tzu: asymmetric warfare;
     "tactics without strategy is noise before defeat"
     objective --> strategy --> tactics
        Ali had strategy to tire opponent, used take abuse tactics
     Strategy:
       plan for the hard things - not for sun burn
       Health span deterioration:
         1. cognitive decline - speed, memory, problem solving, Sentience
         2. physical body - muscle, bone density,  stamina, balance
         3. emotional - age independent - can take a hit at any age
            happiness nadir (lowest) is 47 - love, purpose
     Tactics:
       life interwoven; 1. exercise - more important than 2.
                             strength, stability, aerobic efficiency/capacity
                        2. nutrition
                             eat less
                        3. sleep - more important than 2.
                        4. emotional health
                            no hard data, but very important
                            not worth to live longer and be unhappy
                        5.drugs/hormones/supplements
                            cholesterol lowering
    Evidence informed strategy
      1. centenarians
      2. animal models
      3. studies of 1.heart 2. cancer 3. neuro-degenerative 4. metabolic
      4. molecular/cellular studies
    Mendelian randomization; use gene variation to find causal effect of an exposure
      fill gap between randomized tests & epidemiology (causal/non-causal)
      example: epidemiology: lower cholesterol --> higher cancer
      randomized proxy: genes that result to how/medium/high cholesterol
        --> cholesterol does not effect cancer but does effect cardio disease

4 Centenarians
  Jeane Calment: rode bike until 100, smoked until 117, died 122
  Others: beer/bacon/Bourbon/cigar/3-eggs (Bourbon County, Kentucky)
  Genes responsible for ~25% of longevity variation
  Long lived siblings or (2nd) parents --> importance of family history
    can we mimic the good genes if we do not have them?
    20% get cancer by 72, 20% Centenarians get cancer by 100
  Centenarian genes not obvious - maybe thousands
    many paths to longevity;
    longevity is not result of natural selection
    few genes for cholesterol, glucose metabolism & Alzheimer
  After age of reproduction, natural selection is irrelevant
  Baldness/Alzheimer's genes activate after reproduction
  "Antagonistic Pleiotropy":  aging is a side effect of fertility genes
  Alzheimer's gene: APOE (apoliprotein E)  - makes lipoproteins to pkg cholesterol
    25% of people have APOE4, and 2 to 3% have two copies
    e3 is most common, e2/e4 is Alzheimer's protection/risk
  FOXO3: cardiomyocytes: autophagy, proliferation, size/survival
  gene expression influenced by environment & behavior
  strategy:
    1. disease specific prevention
    2. general prevention

5. Eat less, live longer
   Rapamycin (sirolimus)
     anifungal by  Streptomyces hygroscopicus, in soil from Rapa Nui commonly known as Easter Island
     for transplants & longevity (non-approved)
     its drug analog used for kidney cancer
     slows down cell growth - blocks mTOR
   mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) protein complex in cells
     controls growth,  plenty food --> mTOR activated
   2009 experiment: old mice longevity ~+10% with rapacycin
     reproduced in 3 labs
     similar with yeast, worms, fruit flies
     (2006 resveratrol [in grapes] longevity not reproduced)
   Consistent with food reduction increasing longevity since Hippocrates
   Alvise Coprnaro (died 1565)
     sick from too many feasts
     reduced food (with 2 glasses wine) to get well, wrote "Discourses on sober life"
     best diet book
   CR
     caloric restriction wo malnutrition
     mice/rats lived 15% to 45% longer
     similar for yeast, flies, fish, dogs, spiders
     not recommended - frailty may offset gains
