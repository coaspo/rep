Longer healthier life
  30 min/day rigorous exercise
  body mass index 18-24
  easier said than done

Sodium/Potassium
  Na +1gr/day --> +18% cardiovascular disease
  K     ''        -18%                       ; fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy

Mediterranean Diet
  low levels of Prevotella copri in gut --> less inflammation

Use metabolomics (biomarkers) instead of diet journal
  metabolomics - measurement of all metabolites and low-molecular-weight molecules in a biological specimen
    or chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind
     DNA (genomics) -->
       RNA (Transcriptomics) -->
         Proteins (Proteomics) -->
           Biochemical (Metabolomics) --> Biological Phenotype
              (Phenotype: characterics from genotype + environment)

Aquatic animals:
  zinc, iron, magnesium, selenium, iodine, copper,
  vitamins A, B6, B12, D
  and docosahexaenoic acid(DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
  more nutritious than land animals
  omega-3 in fat tissue

Algae & water spinach


Contaminant:
  methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
    90% of the PCBs and dioxins are from land animals
  mercury: swordfish, shark,bluefin tuna, yellowfin or ahi tuna,
           canned white albacore tuna, king, mackerel, marlin, golden bass)

‚Äúbiologically sustainable‚Äù fish: 90%/1974 --> 66%/2017

aquaculture
   nitrogen/phosphorus emissions, disease, antibiotics, and escaped species

Anti-Nutrients
  deactivated by soaking, sprouting, or boiling

  1. Lectins or hemagglutinins - carbohydrate binding proteins
    blocks: calcium, iron, phosphorus, and zinc.
    in: legumes, whole grains, lentils, peanuts;
        tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplant
        (low in walnuts, pistachios)
    remove: soak, cook ,
            baking soda, vinegar

    cell-cell interactions, signaling pathways, and immune responses
    viable target for targeted drug delivery systems
    bind to cells for long periods of time
    take few days - a week to come out of
     ricin in castor beans is a lectin
    high in raw beans, grains, potato skin
      --> red blood cells clump, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea
      increased gut permeability and drive autoimmune diseases


  2. Oxalates; C2O4 - from plants incomplete oxidation of saccharides
     blocks: iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium
     in: spinach, soy, almonds, potatoes, beets, navy
     remove: steaming 5-53%, boiling 30-87%
             eat calcium foods for couple of days or weeks

     C2O4 + calcium --> calcium oxalate; kidney stones
                    CaC2O4, hydate CaC2O4¬∑nH2O
                    CaC2O4 from plants detoxifying calcium (Ca2+)

      Oxalic acid, C2H2O4 uses: rust/inorganic stain removal
                                laundry rinse

   3. Phytates (phytic acid)  - organophosphorus compound of plants
      blocks (for large amounts): iron, zinc, magnesium  Chromium Manganese

      in: beans, seeds, nuts, grains
           phytin mostly in seed husks
      remove: heat and pressure or with a strong acid
              phytase enzyme;
                 Germination increase it
                   malting (germination/heat & dry) decreases remaining phytic acid
                 found in: plants, and microbes
                    grains, legumes
                    gut of ruminant animals (we do not produce it)
                 added to animal feed

      phytic acid: inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)
        not all bad; involved in gene regulation
        use in endodontics, adhesive, preventive, and regenerative dentistry
        used as the preservative

        unavailable for absorption in pigs -->  malnutrition+phosphorus in the manure
            Canadaian genetic Enviropig produces phytase in saliva in limited production

   4. Saponis - triterpene glycosides; foaming
      toxic: salivation, diarrhea, vomiting, appetite loss, and paralysis
             effect Alzheimer's/Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's (nerve cell is brain) disease
      uses:  decrease blood lipids, lower cancer risks, and lower blood glucose response.
             inhibition of dental caries and platelet aggregation, treat  hypercalciuria,
             lead poisoning  antidote
      in: chickpeas, broad (fava) beans, soybean, lentils, kidney beans,
          peanuts,..spinach leaves, quinoa
      remove: wash, cook & ferment
         hot water Washing quinoa reduces it 20%

      soapwort boiled down to make soap
      hydro & lipo philic
      vaccine adjuvants

   5. Tannins -  astringent (shrinks tissue) (tannin - oak bark)
     block: iron;  bind (chelate) iron
        form complexes with proteins, starch and digestive enzymes and
        reduce the nutritional values of foods
        cheek and oesophageal cancers
        precipitate proteins, inhibit digestive enzymes,
        speed blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease the serum lipid level,
        produce liver necrosis, and modulate immunoresponses.
     toxic: stomach irritation, nausea, vomiting, and liver damage
     good: anticarcinogenic, microbial regulator; inhibit fungi, bacteria, and viruses
        small amount & right type improve human health
        Antimutagenic  (like UV blockers)
      in: highest in apples
          legume seeds, cider, cereals, cacao, peas, leafy and green vegetables,
          coffee, tea, and nuts,
          Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries
          Beer, wine, tea, fruit juices and cider
          cinnamon or curry powder
      remove: 1/4 tsp.  baking soda in tea - most tannins are acidic

      deter eating unripe fruit/seeds
      act as pesticides
      50% of the dry weight of leaves
      produce black water rivers
      controls plant recycling
      puckery feeling from tasking unripened fruit, red wine or tea.
      tannin free feed --> high wight gain, more eggs, low chicken mortality

   6. Glucosinolates
       block: idodine;
              disrupt the production of thyroid hormones
              cause goiter; aggravate hypothyroidism
               not toxic to humans given normal iodine intake.
       good: inflammation, stress response, metabolism, antioxidant,
              antimicrobial, anticancer
              ‚Äúturn on‚Äù genes that suppress tumors
              shift active estrogen to a weaker form
       in: Cruciferous vegetables; cabbage, broccoli, kale
           mustard, horseradish  Brussels sprouts, watercress, horseradish, capers, and radishes
       remove: stir fry, boil


      Glucosinolates: secondary metabolites (ecological interaction)
           from glucose and an amino acid - have sulfur & hydrogen

   7. Goitrogens
      block: same as Glucosinolates
             brain damage, mental retardation, reproductive failure, and childhood mortality
      in: same as Glucosinolates, almonds
      remove: wash, soak, and boil
              (destroys enzyme that converts progoitrin to goitrin)
