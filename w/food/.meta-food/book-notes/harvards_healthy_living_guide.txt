Longer healthier life
  30 min/day rigorous exercise
  body mass index 18-24
  easier said than done

Sodium/Potassium
  Na +1gr/day --> +18% cardiovascular disease
  K     ''        -18%                       ; fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy

Mediterranean Diet
  low levels of Prevotella copri in gut --> less inflammation

Use metabolomics (biomarkers) instead of diet journal
  metabolomics - measurement of all metabolites and low-molecular-weight molecules in a biological specimen
    or chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind
     DNA (genomics) -->
       RNA (Transcriptomics) -->
         Proteins (Proteomics) -->
           Biochemical (Metabolomics) --> Biological Phenotype
              (Phenotype: characterics from genotype + environment)

Aquatic animals:

Contaminant:
  methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
    90% of the PCBs and dioxins are from land animals
  mercury: swordfish, shark,bluefin tuna, yellowfin or ahi tuna,
           canned white albacore tuna, king, mackerel, marlin, golden bass)

“biologically sustainable” fish: 90%/1974 --> 66%/2017

Anti-Nutrients
  binding to vitamins,minerals, preventing their uptake, or inhibiting enzymes
  deactivated by soaking, sprouting, boiling, pressure cooking

  1. Lectins or hemagglutinins - carbohydrate binding proteins
    blocks: calcium, iron, phosphorus, and zinc, damages intestines
            trigger autoimmune response
    how: stick to intestines and increase permeability --> micro trauma
         --->Leaky gut syndrome
    in: grains, legumes (1-3%)(Lentils,Peas,Broad beans,Chickpeas,Soybeans,Beans,Peanuts);
        potatoes, Nightshades (tomatoes, peppers,  eggplant)
        (low in walnuts, pistachios)
    remove: soak, cook ,Protease inhibitors
            baking soda, vinegar
    side effects: inflammation, brain fog, migraines, stomach issues, acne or joint pain
                  Nightshades: auto immune disease
    glycoproteins
    cell-cell interactions, signaling pathways, and immune responses
    viable target for targeted drug delivery systems
    bind to cells for long periods of time
    take few days - a week to come out of
     ricin in castor beans is a lectin
    high in raw beans, grains, potato skin
      --> red blood cells clump, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea
      increased gut permeability and drive autoimmune diseases


  2. Oxalates; C2O4 - oxilic acid
     blocks: iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium
     in:  rhubarb, tea, spinach, parsley, purslane, swiss chard, parsley, collards

            glycoproteins eat calcium foods for couple of days or weeks
             drink enough fluids
             eat calcium rich foods - Oxalates bind to calcium in stomach
     how: oxalates bind to calcium in your blood -->  oxalic acid
          --> muscle & kidney pain
     possible side effects: burning in the eyes, ears, mouth and throat
                            abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea and diarrhea
     C2O4 + calcium --> calcium oxalate; kidney stones

                   malting (germination/heat & dry) decreases remaining phytic acid
                 found in: plants, and microbes
                    grains, legumes
                    gut of ruminant animals (we do not produce it)
                 added to animal feed
      good: lower cholesterol, slow digestion, and
            prevent sharp rises in blood sugar.

      phytic acid: inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)
        not all bad; involved in gene regulation
        use in endodontics, adhesive, preventive, and regenerative dentistry
        used as the preservative

        unavailable for absorption in pigs -->  malnutrition+phosphorus in the manure
            Canadaian genetic Enviropig produces phytase in saliva in limited production

   4. Saponis - triterpene glycosides; foaming
      toxic: salivation, diarrhea, vomiting, appetite loss, and paralysis

   5. Tannins -  astringent (shrinks tissue) (tannin - oak bark)
     block: iron;  bind (chelate) iron
        form complexes with proteins, starch and digestive enzymes and
        reduce the nutritional values of foods
        cheek and oesophageal cancers
        precipitate proteins, inhibit digestive enzymes,
        speed blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease the serum lipid level,
        produce liver necrosis, and modulate immunoresponses.
     toxic: stomach irritation, nausea, vomiting, and liver damage
     good: anticarcinogenic, microbial regulator; inhibit fungi, bacteria, and viruses
        small amount & right type improve human health
        Antimutagenic  (like UV blockers)

          cinnamon or curry powder
      remove: 1/4 tsp.  bakamylase, trypsin and pepsining soda in tea - most tannins are acidic

      deter eating unripe fruit/seeds
      act as pesticides
      50% of the dry weight of leaves
      produce black water rivers
      controls plant recycling
      puckery feeling from tasking unripened fruit, red wine or tea.
      tannin free feed --> high wight gain, more eggs, low chicken mortality

   6. Glucosinolates (a goitrogen: disrupts thyroid hormones)
       block: idodine;
              disrupt the production of thyroid hormones
              cause goiter; aggravate hypothyroidism
               not toxic to humans given normal iodine intake.
       good: inflammation, stress response, metabolism, antioxidant,
              antimicrobial, anticancer

           mustard, horseradish  Brussels sprouts, watercress, horseradish, capers, and radishes
       remove: stir fry, boil


      Glucosinolates: secondary metabolites (ecological interaction)
           from glucose and an amino acid - have sulfur & hydrogen

    7. Enzyme inhibitors
       1. protease (protein/peptide enzyme)
           trypsin (small intenstine, in legumes), pepsin (stomach)
           lectins
       2. lipase: prevent hydrolysis of lipids
       3. amylase: prevent breaking of carbohydrates, in beans

    8. Gluten
       in: Wheat, rye, oats, barley and rye
       side effects: leaky gut --> mental fog, digestive discomfort,
                     joint pain, poor nutrient absorption

Cravings
   brain messages, habits, easy access to food.
   hyperpalatable foods (sweetness, saltiness, or richness)
     activate neurons in the reward brain region, creating pleasure
     release metabolic, stress, and appetite hormones;
       insulin, cortisol, dopamine, leptin, and ghrelin
   hypothalamus:
     1%, pea sized: controls cravings, appetite
     chemicals/hormones  for stress, pleasure, pain, and hunger.
     dopamine, the “feel good” chemical,
     Eating certain foods that stimulate the reward -->
       addictive food behaviors or emotional overeating.
     eating --> appetite hormones;
       digestive tract: glucagon-like peptide & cholecystokinin
